Yet on November 12, 2020, Malkemus, “Commenced a summary non-payment proceeding in White Plains City Court … seeking to evict Talley from the home and for a money judgment against Talley in the amount of $515,872,97 representing alleged arrears,” new court papers state.</p><p>Talley — who in 1988 was appointed by Anna Wintour to be the creative director of Vogue, the first African-American person to ever hold the position — responded by filing his own lawsuit against Malkemus and Yurgaitis in Westchester Supreme Court on January 25, 2021.</p><p>He claims the pair, who were “long-time, trusted friends,” agreed to buy the home for him and transfer the title once he had repaid them the $1,020,000 purchase price.</p><p>While Malkemus and Yurgaitis allege Talley is behind in rent, the former Vogue editor-at-large’s filing alleges, “This action arises out of the Defendants’ improper attempt to evict Talley from a home … that is rightfully his, so that they may sell the property.”</p><p>He claims that he has lived at the home since and paid back more than the purchase price, totaling $1,075,588, as of January 2020, with his court papers stating: “He has also paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to third parties to maintain and improve the home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51krq%2Bw0Z5kpZ2fo3q1rculnLJllau2pMDIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cedric-gervais-enlists-willy-monfret-for-make-me-feel.html><span>←</span><span>Cedric Gervais Enlists Willy Monfret On Deep House Tune Make Me Feel</span></a>
