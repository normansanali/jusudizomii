As a teenager, he attended the Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, where he played high school football. In school, Fitzgerald was a two-time first-team All-State wide receiver. During this time, he gained additional experience by working as a ball boy for the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Because he initially failed to meet NCAA requirements coming out of high school, Fitzgerald spent a year at Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>Fitzgerald attended the University of Pittsburgh for college and played for the Panthers football team. He was an instant star in his freshman season in 2002, recording 69 receptions for 1,005 yards and 12 touchdowns and leading his team to victory at the Insight Bowl. Fitzgerald had an even more impressive sophomore season, leading the Big East conference with 92 receptions for 1,672 yards and leading the whole NCAA with 22 touchdowns. Following the season, he won the Walter Camp Award as the best player in the NCAA, and came in second for the Heisman Trophy. Fitzgerald subsequently left Pitt to enter the NFL Draft. He finished his collegiate career with a school record of 34 receiving touchdowns.</p><h2 id=arizona-cardinals-2004-2013><strong>Arizona Cardinals, 2004-2013</strong></h2><p>In the 2004 NFL Draft, Fitzgerald was chosen third overall by the Arizona Cardinals. He had a solid rookie season with the team, posting 59 receptions for 780 yards and eight touchdowns. Fitzgerald significantly upped his game in 2005, leading the NFL with 103 receptions for 1,409 yards and earning his first Pro Bowl selection. The following season, he recorded 69 receptions for 946 yards and six touchdowns. After the 2007 season, Fitzgerald signed a four-year contract extension with the Cardinals. He went on to have a superb season in 2008, with 96 receptions for 1,431 yards and an NFL-leading 12 touchdowns. Moreover, the Cardinals made it to the playoffs, where they proceeded to beat the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles en route to Super Bowl XLIII. Ultimately, the Cardinals fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the game. Despite the loss, Fitzgerald set a new single-postseason record with 546 receiving yards, 30 receptions, and seven touchdown receptions. It was later revealed that he had played the entire postseason with a broken left thumb.</p><p>Fitzgerald had another impressive season in 2009, posting 97 receptions for 1,092 yards and an NFL-leading 13 touchdowns. The Cardinals once again made it to the playoffs, but fell to the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional Round. In the 2010 season, Fitzgerald had 90 receptions for 1,137 yards and six touchdowns as the Cardinals failed to return to the playoffs. The next year, he signed an eight-year contract with the team. Fitzgerald's 2011 season was another strong one; among the highlights, he set a new personal record of 17.6 yards per catch. He capped things off with his sixth Pro Bowl appearance. In the 2012 season, Fitzgerald had 71 receptions for 798 yards and four touchdowns. The Cardinals missed the playoffs again while Fitzgerald appeared in his seventh career Pro Bowl. Moreover, he was named the Cardinals' <a href=# title="Walter Payton Net Worth">Walter Payton</a> NFL Man of the Year. Fitzgerald made his eighth Pro Bowl in 2013.</p><h2 id=arizona-cardinals-2014-2020><strong>Arizona Cardinals, 2014-2020</strong></h2><p>Although Fitzgerald's personal performance wasn't as strong as usual in 2014 – he had 63 receptions for 784 yards and two touchdowns – the Cardinals were able to make it back to the playoffs. However, the team didn't make it far, falling to the Panthers in the Wild Card Round. The 2015 season was better all around, as Fitzgerald finished with 109 receptions for 1,215 yards and nine touchdowns to help lead the Cardinals to the NFC West title. He continued his success in 2016, leading the NFL in receptions with 107 and making his tenth career Pro Bowl. With the retirements of <a href=# title="Anquan Boldin Net Worth">Anquan Boldin</a> and <a href=# title="Steve Smith Net Worth">Steve Smith</a> the following year, Fitzgerald became the career leader in receptions and receiving yards among all active players. He proceeded to have an exceptional 2017 season, tying his career best of 109 receptions.</p><p>Fitzgerald had some major career highlights in 2018. In Week 10, he reached 15,952 career receiving yards, the second-most of all time behind <a href=#>Jerry Rice</a>. Four weeks later, he set the record for most receptions with one team, with 1,282. In 2019, Fitzgerald surpassed <a href=#>Tony Gonzalez</a> for the second-most career receptions of all time. He had a less successful 2020, as he was placed on the reserve list after testing positive for COVID-19. Fitzgerald finished that season with a career-low 54 receptions for 409 receiving yards and one touchdown across 13 games. He officially retired from NFL playing in 2022, and soon after joined ESPN's "Monday Night Countdown."</p><h2 id=other-endeavors><strong>Other Endeavors</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Fitzgerald honored his promise to his late mother to finish his education when he completed his undergraduate degree with the University of Phoenix. He has since become a paid spokesperson for the school. In other business endeavors, Fitzgerald became a part-owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns in 2020. He is also an active venture investor, and runs his own travel business.</p><p>Fitzgerald is also active in philanthropy. He established the Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund to support kids and their families through athletic activities, educational programs, and various donations. Fitzgerald also established the Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund in honor of his mother, who passed away from breast cancer in 2003.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Fitzgerald was previously in a relationship with Angela Nazario, with whom he had two sons. In 2008, Nazario filed an order of protection against him for abusing her at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jqWYq6qpYrOqwNmgnKuZnJl6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./174633-kylie-jenner-responds-rumors-2am-date-ex-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner Responds to Rumors of 2AM Date with Ex Tyga after Reported Travis Scott Break</span></a>
