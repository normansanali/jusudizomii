This chocolate chip pizookie&nbsp;is a warm, ooey, gooey chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream. It all starts with browning the butter in a cast iron skillet and adding both white and brown sugar, then stirring until nice and smooth. &nbsp;It will look like smooth caramel and smells like homemade toffee.

Oh how I love you, I Want to Marry You Cookies. These are the cookies that won me the Cooking Channel’s Perfect 3 Cookie Contest and I was able to film a segment in the Food Network Studios. An unreal experience that I will never forget! These cookies ended up being the most popular recipe on Cooking Channel in 2012.

To all of the teenagers out there who have ever had a boy dump you and break your heart, take note. These brownies are way better than that dude. I shared a story of my own personal teenager turmoil and how I made one huge mistake in a relationship — don’t toilet paper your boyfriend’s house. I am sharing my story to help all of the teenagers out there (haha). You are welcome.

No surprise here. My family was actually shocked when I shared this recipe. It was one that I worked on for so long to master. I flew to NYC and did some investigative work to figure out how Levain Bakery made their famous cookies.</p><p>I came home and tried so many versions I found on the internet but ended up disappointed. I decided to start from scratch. I tweaked the ratios of ingredients over and over and increased and decreased the oven temperature until I felt that I had nailed the Levain Bakery chocolate chip cookie recipe. I almost shed tears in my kitchen. They quickly became my husband’s favorite cookie of all time! These are by far the most popular recipe on my blog and after one year on Modern Honey, they are still holding on to their 5 star rating.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/collage-2016.jpg alt="Modern Honey Top 10 Most Popular Posts from 2016.
