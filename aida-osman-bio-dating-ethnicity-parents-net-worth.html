But this beauty took her talents on-screen in 2022. Appearing as “Shawna Clark” on HBO Max’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rap Sh!t</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, this comedic writer took the world by surprise.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Aida Osman On HBO Max’s Rap Sh!t</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>HBO Max’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rap Sh!t</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on July 21, 2022, and within a week it hit 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. So, the cast must be doing something right! Well, we don’t know about others, but Aida claimed she was “the only person that could ever do Shawna and this was supposed to be this way.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Recalling the casting process, Aida mentioned she was “really lucky” to find the show with “perfect synthesis.” However, it indeed was scary at first. She had to spend the first two or three episodes of filming like “Are y’all sure? Like we could start over? Recast me and it’d be cool. Like nobody would know, I haven’t even told people I’ve been cast in this like, are you sure?” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But over time, she got the hang of it and fell in love with the character. Furthermore, she even helped develop the character with a group of amazing writers and kept giving Shawna her personal stories about her real life — from trying to become a rapper in LA.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>By the end, she felt that she was the only person that could ever do Shawna!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida explained her character to be a music enthusiast who went to Spelman. Also, the actress revealed her character was dating a great guy who was going to be a lawyer. “She’s just seeing the music industry kind of formulaically. She’s doing calculus instead of just living and making art,” the star added.</span></p><h3><b>Aida Osman Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida Osman garnered a net worth of under $500 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This emerging actress first started her career as a comic writer working on the podcast series</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Keep It</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2017, and the TV mini-series </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Group Therapy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But it wasn’t until 2021 after she wrote for Netflix’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Big Mouth</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and HBO’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Betty</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that Aida marked her presence in the industry.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Aida was discovered by Netflix for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Big Mouth </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>after she dropped a nonchalant rap about pegging that went viral.</span></p><h3><b>Is Aida Osman Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida Osman might have revealed that her character was dating “a great guy who was going to be a lawyer,” but she didn’t say who her real-life partner was.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The only thing we know about her dating life (in 2022) was that she had a “small dating pool” and she missed “getting skewered, missed existing for free in someone’s mind, and missed (her) name being scribbled in his therapist’s notes.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But with that being said, we also do know that this beauty, who is nonbinary (using she/they pronouns),&nbsp; likes tall men. Infact, she likes tall boys so much that she hates being a stereotype. “I hate loving tall men. I hate being a stereotype I wish I loved short kings. maybe I’ll just force it and pretend I can feel their d*ck inside me,” she joked.</span></p><h3><b>Aida Osman Ethnicity</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida Osman flaunts Eritrean roots, and she often missed Eritrea, a country in East Africa</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, the star described herself as a “ woman of color.”</span></p><h3><b>What Is Aida Osman Nationality?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida Osman is American. Her FB mentioned that she hails from Washington D.C.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, in an interview with Vanity, Aida once shared that her hometown is Lincoln, Nebraska.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Aida’s real name is Aida Goitom and it’s pronounced as “AH-yee-da GOY-tum.”</span></p><h3><b>Aida Osman Parents</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aida Osman’s parents separated when she was just a kid. So, she was raised alone by her mother Semira Osman whom she loves to the moon.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fortunately, Aida’s mother soon found love and went on to marry Yacoub Idris, a social justice activist.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The star’s close to her stepfather as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the other hand, she’s still bitter about how her biological father left her. “I wish my father would have come back after going out for cigarettes that one day so I could stop over sharing… with strangers…. but he didn’t… so alas… I tweet,” she once tweeted.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, her father is from Keren, Eritrea.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Aida’s mother got her gallbladder out in 2022.

This time it so happened in the water and it only took a short while to cause deadly brain damage. See his body couldn’t stop the water the way mine or yours would when you start to drown. Not when he was seizing,” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After Sam died of drowning, the Osman family was charged with wrongful death litigation.
