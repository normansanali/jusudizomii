The 23-year-old’s latest look for the Avellano show on March 7 was definitely wild as she rocked a tight blue latex dress with shaved and bleached eyebrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/noah-cyrus-paris-fashion-week-latex-dress-2023-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>For the show, Noah wore a tight, dark blue long-sleeve turtleneck gown that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hugged her frame</a> and flowed into a pleated skirt from the knees down and trailed on the floor. Noah styled the blue dress without any accessories and instead, she completely shaved and bleached her eyebrows, adding a smokey eye, voluminous lashes, and a matte nude lip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Aside from this look, another one of Noah’s quirky fashion week looks was her black dress with a cutout bodice that showed off <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her topless chest</a>, and the only thing covering up her chest was a massive black chain. Her tight black long-sleeve Stephane Rolland Fall 2023 dress had a gaping cutout on the front and she opted to go braless beneath the dress, leaving her entire chest out on full display. A long black chain barely covered up her chest and she accessorized with a pair of sheer black tights and black patent leather heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/noah-cyrus-paris-fashion-week-latex-dress-2023-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>for her glam</a>, Noah had her long black hair down and parted in the middle in loose waves while her eyebrows were totally bleached. A sultry smokey eye with a cat-eye liner and a glossy nude lip tied her look together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Another one of our favorite looks from Noah was at the Alexandre Vauthier Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2023 show when she wore a completely see-through black pleated gown. The long-sleeve flowy, oversized dress showed off her plunging <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sequin bra</a> and underwear beneath and she topped her look off with natural, minimal glam.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e49xZqenkZ16pMXRrqpmpJGpsrl5w6ucrKtdl7mmrcKhnJ1lla6yo77OsKpmqJaserG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mindy-grossman.html><span>←</span><span>Mindy Grossman</span></a>
