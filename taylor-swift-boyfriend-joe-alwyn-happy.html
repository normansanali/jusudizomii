In addition to The Favourite, Alwyn is filming period drama Mary Queen of Scots, which stars Margot Robbie and Saoirse Ronan.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Karwai Tang/WireImage; James Devaney/GC Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-swifts-parents-are-fans-of-their-relationship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2.
