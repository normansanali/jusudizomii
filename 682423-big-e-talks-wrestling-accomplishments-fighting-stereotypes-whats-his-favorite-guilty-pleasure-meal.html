As an athlete, winning the state high school wrestling title really sticks out to me. I wasn’t very good, and I was getting beaten up a lot at that time, so it took a lot to turn that around."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

You can read a few excerpts below:&nbsp;</p><p>As an athlete, winning the state high school wrestling title really sticks out to me. I wasn’t very good, and I was getting beaten up a lot at that time, so it took a lot to turn that around. Also, even though it didn’t turn out how I hoped, signing my letter of intent to play football at Iowa University is something I remember. I’ll always be proud of being a Hawkeye.</p><p>Anyone who has seen my team knows we aren’t the typical mean tough guys who are only up for a fight. The industry is changing, and a lot of people aren’t familiar with where it is right now. We all graduated college and are intellectual people and real athletes. I think there needs to be a changing perspective.</p><p><b><i>What’s Big E’s guilty pleasure meal?&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>We’re on the road a lot, so it changes. I try to get 300 grams of protein and go from there. Now that I’m getting older (he’s 30), I’m trying to cut back on red meat intake. But sushi is definitely my favorite guilty pleasure, because there’s so much you can do with it. I only eat it when I’m home, because you never know with sushi.</p><p>We get to see the world. We go all over, and I feel like I’ve been places I never would’ve been otherwise. And I’m making people laugh. If I get the chance to make somebody smile who’s having a bad day or if somebody is down in life, and I can alleviate that for a minute, that’s what I love.</p><p>Rocky 4 definitely, and maybe Rocky 3 is right behind that. But the fourth one is a classic piece of American cinema. Training montages are beautiful and motivational. And there’s a definite David and Goliath thing going on that I relate to. It’s a beautiful film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpdra2trXZe2qHnEZquapJuoeri%2BxKyrpaGenHqir8KopKmkmai1rrHNrapmnpmctbW1zaBkrKyVp7KwwNipnKxlp52utb%2BMoaCsZZaWw7C%2ByK2cZp%2Blnrm1xYypo56Zo6q%2FpnnMnpil</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-you-need-to-know-about-catherine-missal.html><span>←</span><span>All You Need To Know About Catherine Missal</span></a>
