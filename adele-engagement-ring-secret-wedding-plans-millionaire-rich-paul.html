The former couple tied the knot six years later in May 2018, but she admitted their relationship had a <a class=hm-link href=#>"traumatic" breakdown</a> shortly afterwards, and she filed for divorce in September 2019.</p><p id=ew3fLETUdjYA data-wc=2><strong>SHOP NOW:&nbsp;<a aria-label="11 best bridal separates: From tulle skirts to slinky satin camis and more" class=hm-link href=#>11 best bridal separates: From tulle skirts to slinky satin camis and more</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Adele engaged to Rich Paul?</h2><p id=emstEZHeBsSH data-wc=36>In November 2021, four months after going public with her relationship, Adele was spotted wearing a gold band on her ring finger. She then attended the 2022 BRIT Awards wearing a pear-shaped rock from Lorraine Schwartz.</p><p id=esQZz1n_OYZv data-wc=53>On the subject of her diamond ring on her left hand, Adele previously told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ELLE</a>: "I'm not married. I’m not married!" she said, adding: "I'm just in loooove! I'm happy as I'll ever be. I might as well be married."&nbsp;The 34-year-old later clarified: "I’m not engaged. I just love high-end jewelry, boy!"</p><p id=etLzJxbK6NpP data-wc=26>However, the pear-shaped diamond ring has remained firmly on her left hand since, and we're not surprised considering it's estimated to be worth up to £750k!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f52d1bb4acf9-adele-brit-awards-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ec3O2hlRQlzk data-wc=14><strong>The singer was spotted with a pear-shaped ring on her left hand in 2022</strong></p><p id=etJYUynBP20E data-wc=44>Kyron Keogh, Managing Director and Co-founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ROX</a>, explained: "Adele's ring is a seriously impressive pear-shaped diamond. From the photos, it looks like it's between 8 and 10 carats, with the band delicately set with diamonds. I would estimate it would cost around £750,000."</p><p id=evGDlgEFHrm5 data-wc=59>Meanwhile, Alexandra Michell, Gemologist at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Prestige Pawnbrokers</a> of Channel 4’s , said: "Adele is rocking an approx. 8cts pear cut diamond on a fine platinum band and simple 4 claw setting. The band itself is pave set with small round brilliants on either side of the centre stone. A beautiful design where the pear shape stone diamond really stands out.</p><p id=etUuuuJ9pPv0 data-wc=22>"If this 8cts stone is D colour and IF clarity grade, the price tag would easily top over half a million pounds."</p><h2 dir=ltr>When is Adele getting married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/05bf43fc63b9-adele-relationship-rich-paul-boyfriend-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eI7Owvi4Gej1 data-wc=8><strong>The couple are reportedly planning a 2023 wedding</strong></p><p id=eGoJlwT7Ps98 data-wc=24>There have been reports that Adele is planning a summer wedding with Rich, but she has not made any public comments on the matter.</p><p id=eh-Be2sMnlqy data-wc=25>The singer has been very clear that she "absolutely" wants to get married and have children in the future with Rich, calling herself a "homemaker."</p><p id=eXpSwOJc8zvb data-wc=70>"I've never been in love like this," Adele gushed to ELLE. "I'm obsessed with him. I definitely want more kids. I'm a homemaker and I'm a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music." It seemed her plans to tie the knot and expand her family were on hold, as she added: "But right now, all I got in my brain is Vegas. I wanna [expletive] nail it."</p><p id=eO6LYfd62O2z data-wc=43>During one of her Vegas shows in December, Adele made her feelings for Rich well-known as she paid a gushing birthday tribute to him on stage.
