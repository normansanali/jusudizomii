Joe’s dad Jim was also a football player like his son. His main motivation for becoming a football player in Joe’s life came from his Father’s career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his prime, Jim played in the National Football League but spent the majority of his career in the Canadian Football League (NFL).</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Fans wondered why Jim was in a wheelchair after seeing a photo of him. However, it does not appear to be anything serious, as it has not been reported in the media. It could be because of a knock he received.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>If something bad has happened to him, we promise to report the details, but as of now, it does not seem like it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jim took up various coaching positions later in his career as he deemed it stupid to let his intellect go to waste. He also found success in the coaching field, making you wonder how good of a player he was.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-burrow-net-worth></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Joe Burrow Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Joe has been subject to criticism from fans in the past few games as his performances have not been up to standard. But these past few years have not accurately represented his talents. He is a very talented player and can be much better than he has been in the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>sports brief</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Joe is one of the best earners on his team and holds a net worth of around $10 million. The number has steadily risen in the past few years as he continues to land outstanding performances.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As Joe is still in his earlier days, he will have time to improve his earnings. The recent criticism will push him towards being better as he always wants to show people what he is capable of.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His coaches have said on multiple occasions that he is one of the most dedicated people on the team. And his coach has full belief in him and knows that Joe will start finding his feet very soon.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=follow-joe-on-instagram></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Follow Joe On Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Joe is one of his team’s most popular players since he is young and tenacious. There have been worldwide praises of his ferocity on the pitch as he never leaves a play halfway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Join the 3 million individuals who follow him on Twitter if you want to understand more about his personal life.
