The conversation read as a self-reflection and Rock shared why others might have found him hard to talk to in the past. It has nothing to do with a large Hollywood ego, actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quite the opposite.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=career-confidence>Career Confidence</h2><p>"I'm a total f*cking weirdo. Anybody that knows me, has been around me, has been like, 'What's up with that guy? Does he like me?' People say that sh*t, think I don't like them," Rock revealed, "I suffer from big ego, low self-esteem." For those who see public figures as these invincible beings would be surprised to hear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from a comedic legend</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Explains Why He Wants To Give Cardi B Her Own Comedy Show</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock clarified the difference</a> between his ego and self-love, "When I say big ego it's only about telling jokes. If it's got something to do with my work, I'm the baddest mother f*cker alive. But anything else I just feel not worthy anyone's attention, anyone's love, any accolades." Stern agreed and shared that he presents similar emotions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=learning-and-growing>Learning And Growing</h2><p>The talk show host continued that the kind of confidence they both inhibit often stems from child-parent relationships. Rock bounced off of those thoughts, "It stems from your relationship with your parents. You and I have this in common, you went to a black school I went to a white school. You have this childhood trauma that you haven't dealt with and you think you've dealt with it because you're on the radio and you talk about it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock On The New Season Of 'Fargo': 'It's The Best Role I've Ever Had'</a></span></p><p>The comedian continued, "And I think I've dealt with it because I can write jokes about it. But I never dealt with it. It was just a horrible existence." This point of view and openness goes to show that we never truly know what is going on behind the scenes, and how trauma can affect the way someone relates with others.</p><p>Rock has triumphed over his childhood traumas, including bullying, and&nbsp;created an inspiring career despite his setbacks.&nbsp;He dove deeper into his experiences with bullying and how that has translated into his work. His wisdom and unfiltered thoughts are two of the many reasons his fans look up to him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Rock Identifies The Struggles Of The Black Community In Terms Of Rich Vs.
