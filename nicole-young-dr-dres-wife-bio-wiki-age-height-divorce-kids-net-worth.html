Young cited the reason to file for divorce as the couple had been experiencing irreconcilable differences for a long time. However, after news broke out of the couple’s divorce, Dr. Dre revealed that Nicole had <strong>signed a prenup</strong> prior to their marriage.</p><p>Nevertheless, in recent court proceedings, Dre’s wife asked for $2 Million per month as spousal support. She also claims that she is challenging her husband’s prenup claiming that the legendary record producer tore up their prenup after three years in their marriage. Nicole came up with her monthly <strong>expenses</strong> which explain why she needs $2 Million per month in their recent divorce proceedings. Some claim that the figures are outrageous but we shall let you decide on that:</p><ul><li>Laundry and cleaning $10,000</li><li>Clothes $135,000</li><li>Education (tuition and living expenses) $60,000</li><li>Entertainment $900,000</li><li>Charitable contributions $125,000</li><li>Mortgage $100,000</li><li>Telephone, cell phone, e-mail $20,000</li></ul><p>Additionally, Nicole also revealed that she co-owns the trademark to the name <strong>Dr. Dre </strong>and <strong>the Chronic.&nbsp;</strong>She also stated that Dr. Dre secretly changed the rights to their co-owned company. As a counter, Dr. Dre’s lawyers allege that Young drained their record company account by writing a personal cheque of $350,000. However, her husband Dr. Dre recently agreed to pay temporary spousal support of $2 million, pay the costs associated with her Malibu home, and the costs of her mother’s Pacific Palisades while the divorce continues.</p><p>Dr. Dre signed the contract on his spousal support while in the ICO battling a brain aneurysm.</p><p><span data-darkreader-inline-color>Additionally, Nicole recently revealed in court proceedings of their divorce that Dr. Dre held a gun to her head twice, in 2000 and in 2001. Additionally, her renowned husband punched her in the head and face twice. She was quoted saying:</span></p><p><strong>“He verbally and emotionally decimated my personhood to the extent that I currently suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome”</strong></p><p>Nicole also subpoenaed Jillian Speer, Kili Anderson, and Crystal Rogers (Dr. Dre’s allegedly mistresses) to testify in the divorce case. However, the three dismissed the subpoena citing that they do not have “information relevant to the enforceability” of the pre-marital agreement. creds. <strong>UrbanIslandz</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nicole-young-age-dr-dres-wife-age></span><span>Nicole Young Age | Dr. Dre’s Wife Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>how old is Nicole Young?</strong> Nicole is <strong>50 years old</strong> as of 2020, she was <strong>born on Jan 1, 1970,</strong> in the United States.
