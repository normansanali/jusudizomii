I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph So momma, don’t take my Kodachrome away…”&nbsp;<strong>– Paul Simon</strong></p><p>“If you can get humor and seriousness at the same time, you’ve created a special little thing, and that’s what I’m looking for, because if you get pompous, you lose everything.”&nbsp;<strong>– Paul Simon</strong></p><p>“Most of the time, the songs have jokes in them, little sarcastic things, or purposely kitsch or something. So that’s going along with a story, like I do in life, just talking to myself and making fun of stuff and laughing at stuff that’s serious. And sometimes it’s a good idea to put the laughing into the songs. Sometimes it’s not. Sometimes it’s all right just to be serious. But most of the songs have some kind of joke in them.”&nbsp;<strong>– Paul Simon</strong></p><p>“I don’t really know why an idea comes to me. But all of a sudden, an idea comes, and from experience, I can intuit what something means when an interesting line pops up. Or I can intuit what an interesting choice might be. And I can try a couple of different choices, and see which one feels right, and then continue the song to see where it goes.”&nbsp;<strong>– Paul Simon</strong></p><p>“I don’t feel any pressure from fans. But I’m always in some kind of state of emotional turmoil. I would not describe myself as happy-go-lucky. That’s not to say that I’m not happy.”&nbsp;<strong>– Paul Simon</strong></p><h2>3 Powerful Lessons from Paul Simon</h2><p>After learning everything there is to know about Paul Simon’s wealth and career, let’s look at some of the things we can all learn from him.</p><h3>1.
