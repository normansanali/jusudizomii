His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle,” the family’s statement read. “The Royal Family join with people around the<a href=#> world in mourning his loss</a>. Further announcements will be made in due course.”</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly on Friday that Her Majesty, 94, is “heartbroken” over the loss of her husband. “Prince Philip had been in poor health recently, but the loss was still a surprise,” the insider added.</p><p>Philip, <a href=#>who was born in Corfu, Greece</a>, but moved to France as an infant after his family was exiled, passed away less than a month <a href=#>after he returned home on March 16</a> from a 28-day hospital stay. The former British Royal Navy cadet, who shared four children — <a href=#><strong>Prince Charles</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Princess Anne</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Prince Andrew</strong></a> and <strong>Prince Edward</strong>, with the queen, was admitted to the hospital in February as a “precautionary measure” after feeling ill.</p><p>After undergoing a successful heart surgery for a “preexisting condition” and seeking treatment for “an infection,” he returned home to his wife last month.</p><p>The monarch, who shares <a href=#>eight grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren</a> with Philip, <a href=#>is currently in an eight-day mourning period</a> in accordance with royal tradition.
