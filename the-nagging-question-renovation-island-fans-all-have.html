In fact, we even know how much the Baeumlers really spent on HGTV’s “Renovation Island.” Hence why fans are so flummoxed by the couple’s silence on what happened to their boat. As Meaww points out, during Season 2, Bryan was told his boat had sunk despite being docked on the shore.</p><p>Every major piece of equipment was destroyed after being submerged in saltwater for too long, but Bryan couldn’t understand what had happened since there were no recent, major weather occurrences. Worse still, the Baeumlers’ insurance didn’t cover it, paying out only a minimal amount. Bryan and Sarah were clearly stressed out by the situation, especially since there didn’t seem to be a reasonable explanation for it, but the subject never came up again.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, in the very next episode, the couple was back to work as normal. Fans were confused, with one responding to an Instagram post by demanding to know why nobody was “talking about why the boat sank” anymore, while another admitted, “I really thought you would give more details about how your boat sunk.” On&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>, a commenter cheekily quipped, “Kind of safe… wasn’t your ship sunk by someone in the harbour?” in response to Bryan writing, “A ship in harbour is safe…but that is not what ships are built for.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeq%2BtxqCgp59dpsKmv9Oipqdlopq7sMLAraCopl2ewK2tzZ1kn5meqHqiuMtmn5qulWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gotti-the-day-our-boy-was-stolen-away.html><span>←</span><span>The day our boy was stolen away</span></a>
