It’s obvious it made an impression on audiences, and some of that impact can be attributed to its cast, filled with big names and character actors.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>A lot can change in 30 years, but many of these actors have continued to carve out celebrated careers in Hollywood long after the success of Backdraft.
