Here are Facts You Need To Know</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>If you never read her full profile before stumbling on her posts about “dating athletes”, you would mistake Bianca Peters for a relationship expert. After her opinion on “dating professional athletes” cropped up on Quora platform in 2015, Bianca has been quoted over and over by those who consider her story worth sharing; and they are worth sharing by the way. But that’s not for today. This post is about who Bianca Peters is and what facts you need to know about the sport-loving, Miami-born, TV anchor and journalist.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-bianca-peters></span><strong>Who Is Bianca Peters?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bianca Castillo Peters (a.k.a Bianca Peters) was born in Miami, Florida, on April 1, 1991, into a family of footballers and sports enthusiasts. Therefore, it came as no surprise when little Bianca aspired to pursue a career in professional football. One of her uncles was a footballer and as of this writing, she has a cousin in active football. Although not much is available as to the names of her parents and siblings if any, we do know that Bianca Peters’ family was a loud one when it came to sports, but that didn’t affect her educational pursuit.</p><p>She attended the California State University, Long Beach, where she graduated “summa cum laude” with a bachelor’s degree in communications. She soon moved to Minnesota to pursue a career in sports. But as life continued to have its way, Peters rather saw herself “talking” about sports rather than playing it.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Earlier on in college, Bianca Peters worked for the student-run TV station, College Beat, where she produced and hosted several events including a college football show, which aired weekly. From there it was a long ride across several other TV stations and sports outlets. She moved to ESPN where she covered X-Games. Following her move from ESPN, Peters worked for TBN. There, she worked as a co-host for JUICE TV, a lifestyle program. She later worked as a morning show anchor and reporter for KOBI, NBC5, KOTI, and FOX 26 all based in the south of Oregon. Peters made another move in mid-October of 2016. This time she worked as a traffic reporter at CBS4 News; a duty she still carries out as of this writing. But there’s so much to know about Bianca Peters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-to-know></span><strong>Facts To Know</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-net-worth></span><strong>1. Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bianca Peters’ career has offered her so much experience and exposure in the media space, and some cool earnings too. A late 2018 estimate puts her net worth at $500,000. $500,000 seems like much until it’s compared to her current boyfriend, Danny Amendola’s, $13 million fortune. Woah! Seems like we spilled the beans too soon. More on her love life anon.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-journey-to-miss-california-2010></span><strong>2. Journey to Miss California 2010</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While that may be behind her already, one of the stepping stones to Bianca Peters’ fame and fortune was her clinching the Miss Malibu beauty pageant crown in 2010. Knowing she had the face and brains to compete, Peters signed up for the pageant and invited her parents and grandmother, who she believed were there to only give her moral support.</p><p>In later interviews, Peters confessed just how much energy the victory infused into her self-esteem. That year, Bianca Peters participated in the Miss California pageant but lost to Nicole Johnson, wife of Michael Phelps; albeit she made it to the top ten that year. Perhaps being a beauty queen had its perks too as she would later find her name in the “worth dating” list of several men.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-relationships></span><strong>3. Relationships</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since that time, the beautiful TV anchor has had been in several love affairs and relationships. While her dreams of becoming an athlete never made its way to reality, Peters would console herself by dating them. Make no mistake, she has dated a doctor, bartender and a news anchor like herself, but her A-list lovers have always been professional athletes. Her most serious relationship, as Peters puts it, has been with an unnamed athlete who plays for the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>After their first meeting at the start of their college education, the relationship grew really serious and Bianca Peters moved in with him. For the then twenty-something-year-old Peters, life was at its peak. With her relationship came lots of glitz and glamour. Bianca Peters literally had no challenge about money, not that she does now, but she was being spent on lavishly.</p><p>However, Bianca Peters wanted more from life and soon had a rethink. She wanted to earn her cash, work for her own pay and live with that touch of independence. Thus, she moved to Minnesota to pursue her career in sports broadcasting. She is, as of 2019, rumored to be dating American footballer Danny Amendola. Amendola who plays as a wide receiver for the Detroit Lions has formerly dated sports broadcaster, Kay Adams.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-body-measurements></span><strong>4. Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bianca Peters stands 5 feet 3 inches (1.65 meters) tall and weighs 121 lbs (55 Kg). But as she puts it, she’s 1.9 meters tall and 104 Kg on the inside. In her mind and heart, she says, she was created to be on the football field, but like most other people, genetics had the last word. She wears a bra size of 32B and measures 34-25-34; for her breast-waist-hips. She rocks shoe size 7 (US), has no tattoos, sees through a beautiful pair of black eyes and wears her hair black.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5-favorites></span><strong>5. Favorites</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jacob Elordi and Emma Stone are her best screen actors. She loves shopping and traveling, of course. Paris tops her list of choicest locations to visit. She relishes Burger and Salad. And most unlikely of all, her best color is black, quite expected of a lady who’s into sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yboJqmk5Z6sbHTnqmsZZiav6Z5wKucZp6RmMG0ediorGamlZqxbsDOZqKnp6dk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tati-neves-brazilian-model-claims-justin-bieber-is-good-in-bed-well-endowed-looks-great-naked-report-20131211.html><span>←</span><span>Tati Neves Claims Justin Bieber &amp;quot;Good in Bed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Well Endowed&amp;quot;: Report</span></a>
