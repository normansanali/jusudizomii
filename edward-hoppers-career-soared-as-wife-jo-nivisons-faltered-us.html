 (gentle music) - Edward Hopper first comes to Gloucester in 1912.
 At that time, he's still making his way.
 He hasn't even sold his first painting.
 When he returns in 1923, he meets Jo Nivison.
 We know they were attracted to one another, and they both remember the moment where Edward Hopper began reciting quite slowly, poetry by Paul Verlaine, his favorite symbolist.
 And without missing a beat, Jo picked up where he left off and recited the poem in French."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
