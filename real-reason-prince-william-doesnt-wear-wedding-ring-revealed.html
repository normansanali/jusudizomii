A month before their 2011 wedding, St. James' Palace announced that William would not be given a ring when he and his bride exchanged vows at Westminster Abbey.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/957bc449ae16-kate-ring.jpg><p id=eRHgWKsZ8wM data-wc=45>A palace insider revealed at that time to that William’s choice was one related to personal style. "He’s not one for jewellery," they explained. "He’s never worn any. He decided he didn't want to wear one now. It’s all down to personal preference."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d4147deae939-new.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>HELLO!'s new club for its biggest royal fans is here</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Prince William praises wife Princess Kate as he opens new youth centre" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/fbde4690da13-william-youth-centre.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Prince William praises wife Princess Kate as he opens new youth centre" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Prince William praises wife Princess Kate as he opens new youth centre</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The royal photoshop controversy that went viral before Princess Kate's Mother's Day picture" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8a820f6901d1-gettyimages-1659773249.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The royal photoshop controversy that went viral before Princess Kate's Mother's Day picture" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The royal photoshop controversy that went viral before Princess Kate's Mother's Day picture</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2700173c7a8c-kate-engagement-prince-william.jpg><p id=eZQgUoqUeqM data-wc=76>Meanwhile, in 2018, royal commentator Eloise Parker weighed in on the debate in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Marie Claire</a>. "Although it’s traditional for royal women to wear both an engagement ring and a wedding ring after they get married, it’s never been traditional for royal men to wear one," the royal expert said. "That’s why Prince Philip and Prince William don’t wear them. I think when you have a wedding watched by millions, everyone knows you’re married."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8c5ce6b96df-charles-wedding-ring.jpg><p id=eOtbqKKHA-Ai data-wc=38>Despite being married to <a class=hm-link href=#>the Queen</a> for over 70 years, <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Philip</a> never wore a wedding ring.
