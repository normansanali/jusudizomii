Her book about her marriage to Mr. Canseco, Juicy: Confessions of a Former Baseball Wife, while not particularly well-reviewed, caused a flurry of media attention, including interviews on Entertainment Tonight and Good Morning America, as well as being partially reprinted by Playboy Magazine. The book was released at the same time as Jose Canseco’s own biography, Juiced, was released to the public. Both books detailed the amount of steroid use going on in professional baseball, and Jessica’s book laid out a series of instances where she would find her husband cheating, they would argue, break up and then reconcile. After her relationship with Cancesco ended, she remarried Bel Air-based plastic surgeon Dr. Garth Fisher in 2007, but they divorced in 2011. She is currently running her own cosmetics and medical tattoo business. She is a member of the cast of the new reality series, Hollywood Exes on VH1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKVqMCqr8Bmmpqmo5qwsL%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZaWsLV5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./january-jones-all-time-best-bikini-swimwear-moments-pics.html><span>←</span><span>January Jones All-Time Best Bikini, Swimwear Moments: Pics</span></a>
