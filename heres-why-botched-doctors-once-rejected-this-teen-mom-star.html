Fans love learning the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shocking behind-the-scenes facts about Botched</a>&nbsp;and as it turns out, both&nbsp;Botched and&nbsp;Teen Mom&nbsp;have something in common.</p><p>There is one&nbsp;Teen Mom&nbsp;star who the&nbsp;Botched&nbsp;doctors don't want to work on. Who is? Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=the-2015-incident>The 2015 Incident</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong-willed Farrah Abraham and her daughter Sophia</a> were fan favorites for a while, but before too long, Abraham brought so much drama and tension that MTV fired her from the reality series. And as it turns out, the&nbsp;Botched&nbsp;doctors aren't interested.</p><p>The Botched doctors were worried&nbsp;that if they did some work on her,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Farrah Abraham would complain on social media</a>&nbsp;as she did in 2015 when she had a lip injection and it didn't go so well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Farrah-Abraham-2.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;The Ashley's Reality Round-Up, Dr. Dubrow said that nothing had actually gone wrong with the lip procedure, even though that's the way that Abraham made it sound. He said,&nbsp;“She had a reaction to procedures done properly, and I think she felt that maybe they weren’t necessarily done properly. Things can go wrong, so it’s important that anyone who wants to do something like this understands that.”</p><p>Dr. Nassif explained, "When you have someone that puts things on social media and can be a little bit difficult for someone to deal with, it made us think twice about things."</p><p>It does make sense that if the doctors operated on her and she said something negative on social media, that would affect&nbsp;their business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Mom: The Evolution Of Chelsea Houska, In Photos</a></span></p><p>Abraham <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the photo of her lip injection on Instagram</a> and wrote the caption, "Girlfriends don't say I didn't warn ya ! #BOTCHED California #ER #fixit."

According to&nbsp;People.com, Abraham spent $16,000 to get a chin implant and rhinoplasty in 2012. By the summer of 2013, she had gotten her chest done (for the second time).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have been worried about the star. In 2019, a fan commented on Abraham's Instagram and said that they didn't believe that she should keep getting work done. They wrote, "These things we were born with are natural and because we need them… it’s not healthy for our bodies to keep injecting/laser foreign things in us..u r naturally beautiful so I don’t really understand y ur changing everything on ur natural body,” according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Celebuzz, when Abraham was asked if her daughter would be interested in having some work done, she talked about how she wants her daughter to be open and ask her questions. She said, "I think curiosity, just like with makeup and all the other things that kids are experimenting with, you know, I think it’s great to have conversations just like you would about the birds and bees about plastic surgery."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Teen Mom’ Reddit Fans Think Chelsea Houska is Quiet Because She’s Hiding Her Pregnancy</a></span></p><h2 id=abraham-s-thoughts>Abraham's Thoughts</h2><p>Farrah Abraham's comments on plastic surgery have been a little confusing as she has said two totally different things. In 2019, she said that she didn't feel bad about the work that she had done in the past and would have definitely done some more. She said, "I just want to seem youthful and plump and be happy. I don’t want to ever look like I have bags because I do stay up late, and I do work a lot," according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet.</p><p>The reality star was singing a different tune back in 2016. She said, "I took a chin implant out. I’ve dialed down on the injections because I thought they were too much. There was a lot of stuff. Plastic surgery turns out to be more than you bargained for. I can say that for sure. I kind of just let it all go. The only thing I had to fix were breasts because I was getting serious scarring." She explained that she&nbsp;had the sensation of a "heart attack many nights in a row" and decided that it was time to stop getting so many procedures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will have to wait and see whether Farrah Abraham has any more procedures, but in the meantime, it's interesting to learn why she didn't end up on&nbsp;Botched.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is Teen Mom Star Maci Bookout’s Net Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmaisk52ypXnDqJqtp6KoerC6wp5kq52amrC1scNmq6Gho2LBprHNZqSopV2owaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-ballard-age-family-net-worth-height-is-he-mormon.html><span>←</span><span>Get To Know Tim Ballard Age, Family, Net Worth, Height, Mormon</span></a>
