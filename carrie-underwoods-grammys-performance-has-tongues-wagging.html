She told <a href=#>Women's Health</a> in 2020 that criticism online about her body following the success of her run on "American Idol" shifted her focus to nutrition and fitness. "I shouldn't care what other people think about me," she acknowledged. Nonetheless, this still started her on a path toward feeling good in her own body. "I knew I could be better for myself," she said, "and I let my haters be my motivators."</p><p dir=ltr>Strict diets and limited calorie-counting weren't working for the singer. Instead, she prefers high protein meals to pair with her love of exercise. As for self-care, bubble baths aren't really her thing. "My self-care is my gym time, and that's a stress reliever for me," she said. If only we could all have that kind of motivation!</p><p dir=ltr>Keeping a healthy balance of diet, exercise, skin care, and overall activity, fans still cannot get over Underwood's stunning legs. She laughed during an interview with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, noting genetics definitely come into play, as her legs are naturally more muscular than the rest of her body. However, she did share tips for how she achieves their practically glowing appearance. The big secret? Hydration! Drinking plenty of water, staying healthy, and moisturizing regularly seems to be the recipe for success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWpgaH9ye8KaqauhlWLCr7DEq66op5Soeqi%2BwKaksqtdpbKzss6rpJqmk5p6qa3SZquoppeqsrR51pqeoKGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopezs-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Ben Affleck And Jennifer Lopezs Relationship Timeline</span></a>
