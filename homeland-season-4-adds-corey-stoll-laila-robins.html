And that was a real shame, considering how brilliant the Emmy-winning first season, and slightly lesser but still deeply enjoyable&nbsp;second season, of the Showtime thriller actually were. Now, the show is prepping its fourth season, which is something of a reboot following the conclusion of the Nicholas Brody storyline that had previously propelled the show forward.</p><p data-characters=738 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>Today, we’re hearing that Homeland&nbsp;has recruited two talented actors to fill the void left by Damian Lewis: Corey Stoll and Laila Robins. Stoll, known to audiences for his role as House Representative Peter Russo on Netflix’s political drama&nbsp;House of Cards, will guest star as Sandy Bachman, the CIA Chief of the Station in Pakistan, who’s widely considered to be a rising star in the agency. Stoll, who will star on FX’s&nbsp;The Strain this summer, doesn’t have a great track record for keeping his characters alive, and the fact that he’s billed as a guest star probably means viewers shouldn’t get too attached to Bachman. The number of episodes he’ll appear in is being kept under wraps.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Robins, on the other hand, has joined the cast as a series regular. She’ll play&nbsp;Martha Boyd, the U.S. Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, a neat and professional woman with a stern, clipped tone and&nbsp;dour personality. Robins, perhaps a less familiar face than Stoll, has appeared in&nbsp;In Treatment,&nbsp;Damages and&nbsp;The Sopranos as well as the films&nbsp;Side Effects,&nbsp;The Good Shepherd and&nbsp;True Crime.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Production on season four of&nbsp;<strong>Homeland</strong> will kick off this month in Cape Town, South Africa. It finds Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes), still grieving for Brody, returning to the Middle East as chief of station.&nbsp;Mandy Patinkin, Rupert Friend and Nazanin Boniadi are also returning for the fourth season, which will premiere on Showtime this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu8yeo5qmlGLApq3SqKVmbF2WsaW%2FjJymq52pYsC1u8ulZKWZmaGubr7Om6Cnq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./genshin-impact-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat-the-golden-wolflord.html><span>←</span><span>Genshin Impact: Where to find and how to beat the Golden Wolflord</span></a>
