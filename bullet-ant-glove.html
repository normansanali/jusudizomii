True to its name, the ant supposedly has a sting that feels comparable to being shot with a bullet.</p><p>The sting rates a four out of four on the Schmidt sting pain index, a scale created by entomologist Justin O. Schmidt in the 1980s to categorize and rate the relative pain of different insect stings.</p><p>On its scale of one to four, only the stings of bullet ant and tarantula hawk wasp rate a perfect four.</p><p>Its sting is described as both wildly painful, and excruciating in its length. Schmidt <a href=# rel=noopener>described</a> the sting as feeling like “huge waves and crescendos of burning pain.”</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-140703 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bullet-ant-glove-pain.jpg alt="Bullet Ant Glove Image" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-140703 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Bullet Ant.</span></p><p>The pain continues for up to 24 hours, receding and returning regularly.</p><p>For their manhood ritual, the Mawé submerge hundreds of bullet ants in a natural sedative, rendering them unconscious. These large ants are then woven into gloves made of leaves, with their stingers pointing towards the inside of the glove.</p><p>When the ants regain consciousness, these gloves are then placed on the hands of young men undergoing the ritual. The boy must then keep the gloves on his hand for a full five minutes, while the hundreds of ants repeatedly sting him.</p><p>The bullet ant glove is then removed, but the boy will likely be in pain and shake uncontrollably for hours. He may even experience muscle paralysis, disorientation, and hallucinations.</p><p>To fully complete this initiation, and be accepted as a man by the tribe, the boys must endure this practice a total of 20 times over the course of months or even years.</p><p>This grueling trial is meant to prepare the boys for the traditional life of the Mawé, where he will face all the dangers the jungle has to offer as a hunter and warrior for his tribe.</p><p>Enjoy this article on the bullet ant glove?
