When it was brought up that the company dropped the ball by never putting the titles on Proud and Powerful, Ortiz revealed that it was supposed to happen on two separate occasions, but things didn’t work out.</p><p>“I tend to avoid it at times, but that stuff (opinions from fans that Ortiz & Santana should’ve gotten AEW Tag Title run), it’s almost hard to avoid because we’re constantly tagged in stuff about that,” Ortiz said. “To answer your question, how I felt about it? Ah, I think we could have forced a hand a little bit more when we did have the opportunities that we had, and I can’t completely blame the company because, I mean, there was talks about it, but it was almost like it was never the right time, right?</p><h2 id=h-it-just-wasn-t-our-time>“It just wasn’t our time”</h2><p>“It just wasn’t our time, and it was just kind of because we were always intertwined with a huge storyline with The Inner Circle, and it would have been hard to sway off, and kind of go do our own tag thing and go after the Tag Titles. So, it actually was supposed to happen more than once. But just due to stuff out of our control, out of my control, it just never seemed to pan out.</p><p>“It’s not like those people on the internet that were clamoring for us to be Tag Team Champions — it was noticed by the people in AEW and above and it almost happened two times. It just never panned out. I won’t get into the weeds of things, only because I think I’ll get in trouble if I do [laughs]. That’s pretty much it. It was supposed to happen. It just never did, unfortunately.” [H/T: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POST Wrestling</a>]</p><p><a href=#>Ortiz: Mike Santana Was ‘Very Adamant’ About Not Working With Me</a></p><p>What do you make of Ortiz’s comments?
