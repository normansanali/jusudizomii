Despite the challenges he faced, he was determined to live every day of life as possible.</p><p>However, tragedy struck again in 2011 when Hakeem’s ventilator was mysteriously unplugged at the care facility, leading to his death. According to Hakeem’s lawyer, this unplugging was a conscious act, and an investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding his death.</p><p>Despite the tragic end to his life, Hakeem’s mother notes that he was conscious six months before passing away, could communicate, and even breathed independently for short periods.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Eunice Dwumfour Wikipedia Bio Death Cause Family Details</a></p><h2>Hakeem Pinckney Case Details</h2><p>In August 2009, Pamela Pinckney was driving with her son, daughter, and niece on Interstate 95 in South Carolina’s coastal Lowcountry en route to a Family Dollar store to buy milk.</p><p>Suddenly, her SUV swerved uncontrollably and flipped over multiple times.
