“Baby mamas!” Randall Emmett captioned the Sunday, May 16, Instagram upload, referencing his and Kent’s 2-month-old daughter, Ocean, and Shay’s 3-week-old daughter, Summer. “@scheana congrats on your beautiful daughter!”
The “One More Time” singer, 36, commented, “Awwww I love this!”
Earlier this month, Kent, 30, exclusively told Us Weekly that she and Shay had been having “mommy-oriented” conversations since welcoming their little ones."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

So, can we stop the nonsense? Why do we keep attacking each other?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vanderpump-Rules-Lala-Kent-and-Scheana-Shay-Reunite-Despite-Former-Feud.jpg><p>The Bravo personalities are in <a href=#>a group chat called Mom’s Squad</a>, which also includes <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a>, the Kentucky native, 32, exclusively told Us earlier this month.</p><p>“We all talk every day,” Cartwright, who shares son Cruz, 1 month, with<a href=#><strong> Jax Taylor</strong></a>, said. “We all just bounce things off each other. … It’s perfect. Honestly, we’re a lot closer. And even, like, Scheana and Lala and Stassi, they’re talking and stuff and they’ve had their issues. So being a parent just puts your priorities in check.”</p><p><a href=#>Kent and Shay’s feud</a> began in September 2020 when the California native accused the Give Them Lala Beauty creator of not supporting her following <a href=#>her miscarriage</a> three months prior.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m not tripping too hard,” Kent subsequently said in a “Give Them Lala … With Randall” podcast episode at the time. “She would rather focus on me ‘not being there for her’ than the fact that her man, [<strong>Brock Davies</strong>], said he was working, turned his phone off and went golfing that day. Weird how that was just glazed over.”</p><p>The Utah native told<strong> Zach Peter</strong> in an October 2020 podcast episode that she had been “forcing a friendship with” Shay over the years.</p><p>“Every time she hurts me, she feels bad, she begs for my forgiveness — but it’s usually when there’s a camera in her face — and I forgive her!” Kent explained at the time. “And then she does it again. And I forgive her. And then she does it again. And I’m, like, I haven’t wanted this friendship to continue for years. I just, I keep forgiving you. And at this point, I’m done. I’m checked out. I don’t have room for that type of fakeness in my life anymore.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaprZ2lerPBy56qZqSRoa5ut8Snq2ark52yorrAZqqhmaliv6bBzaKrnmWRm8GmvoyfnK6cXZeuo8WMppimmaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lou-doillon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-197725-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lou Doillon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
