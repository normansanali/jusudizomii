Anita was strong, sexy, and self-assured, which was different than how Moreno saw herself. Anita represented a woman who Moreno admired and wanted to be like, she told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>.

This achievement gave her confidence, and she thought her career was ready to flourish. Disappointingly, things did not go as planned.</p><p>Moreno ended up on a seven-year hiatus.

She called the entire experience humiliating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkG9nbG5fnru0tcOeZK2glWK5qrLEZqafZaKewaJ5zKipnqafZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-to-know-casey-neistats-two-daughters-georgie-and-francine.html><span>←</span><span>Get To Know Casey Neistats Two Daughters: Georgie and Francine</span></a>
