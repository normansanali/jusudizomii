But that’s not all, as Sleiman also revealed that he’ll be playing Phastos’ husband in the movie and that the pair will have children. He also made clear that there’ll be an on-screen kiss between the couple, something he’s very proud of.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, absolutely, and it’s a beautiful, very moving kiss. Everyone cried on set. For me it’s very important to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be. Brian Tyree Henry is such a tremendous actor and brought so much beauty into this part, and at one point I saw a child in his eyes, and I think it’s important for the world to be reminded that we in the queer community were all children at one point. We forget that because we’re always depicted as sexual or rebellious. We forget to connect on that human part.”</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>The first openly gay character in the MCU only arrived in last year’s Avengers: Endgame,&nbsp;with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Russo briefly appearing</a> as an unnamed man who speaks about going on a same-sex date. What’s more, it’s very likely that Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie will retroactively become Marvel’s first LGBT superhero. The warrior was supposed to be confirmed as bisexual in Thor: Ragnarok,&nbsp;but the scene was cut. Her quest to find a queen is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expected to be a big part</a> of&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder,&nbsp;though.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Circling back to <strong>The Eternals</strong>, and this news about Phastos and Sheiman’s character is certainly encouraging to hear and will hopefully be just the beginning of many LGBT+ relationships in the MCU moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK2doqOurb%2BMnKannpmnuqawjJ%2Bcmqylp7JuucKuqmafka56rLXSrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-current-landscape-of-sneaker-endorsements-in-college-basketball.html><span>←</span><span>The Current Landscape of Sneaker Endorsements in College Basketball</span></a>
