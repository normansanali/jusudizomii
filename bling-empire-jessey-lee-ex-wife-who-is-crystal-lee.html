According to Cherie, the two first met each other half a year after Jessey’s divorce from his ex-wife Crystal Lee. However, Crystal has a different story to tell.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Get to know her better as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Bling Empire Star Jessey Lee Ex-Wife, Crystal Lee</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Crystal Lee and the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bling Empire</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star Jessey Lee were married on June 18, 2011. Sadly, nearly four years later, Jessey then filed a divorce petition, and Crystal filed a counterpetition shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, their case proceeding commenced on May 31, 2016, and one of the main reasons for the dispute was the division of their marital property. Fast forward to 3 months of hearing, the court finally made a decision and awarded Crysta $600, 789 as “part of the division of community property between” them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two share two daughters named </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Jazlyn Lee</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (birthday: November 9) and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Joella Lee</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, coming to the timeline, when Jessey and Cherie Chan first met. According to&nbsp; Cherie, it was half a year after Jessey’s divorce from his ex-wife. However, Crystal tagged Cherie in a comment over an IG post from 2015 mentioning “Here’s when she was trying to befriend me when she was really trying to hook up with my husband.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This means Crystal and Cherie have connected in the past.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Bling Empire</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2 newcomer, Leah Qin revealed that she first met Jessey and Cherie at an exotic car event when Jessey was married to Crystal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This revelation made fans wonder if it was the reason why Jessey took so long to marry Cherie as he might be possibly still legally married to his ex-wife. Also, the husband/wife’s abrupt leave from the show in 2022 because they wanted to “focus on their family and businesses,” seemed a little suspicious.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However,&nbsp; we don’t know whose story is true here.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little about Jessey and Cherie, the two got married in Château de Saran, France in 2021, sometime after their engagement in Paris. They share a son and a daughter named Jadore and Jevon.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Crystal Lee Bling Empire Star Jessey Lee Ex-Wife’s Full Name?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Crystal Lee’s full name is Crystal Ling Hoang Lee.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She hails from Dallas, Texas.
