During the nine days, foods traditionally associated with joy, such as wine and meat, are forbidden, except on Shabbat. Bathing, beyond what is absolutely necessary, is prohibited, as is doing laundry, and buying or wearing new clothes.
The nine days culminate in the fast of Tisha B’Av, the Ninth of Av, a day that is spent entirely in mourning —by fasting, praying, sitting on stools instead of chairs and reading the Book of Lamentations.</description></item><item><title> Candice Swanepoel: In Your Face, Darwin!!</title><link>/candice-swanepoel-bikini-ass-photoshoot.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/candice-swanepoel-bikini-ass-photoshoot.html</guid><description>Candice Swanepoel in St. Barts.
