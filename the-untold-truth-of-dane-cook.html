When Dane started out, he was part of a sketch comedy group that included other up-and-coming local comics, one of them being Robert Kelly. On October 30, 1992, a 20-year-old Cook and his troupe managed to snag themselves an amazing opportunity: They were to take the stage at the Boston Garden (then-home of the Celtics) and perform between the Spin Doctors and headliner Phish at Rock of Boston, a concert put on by a local radio station. At the time, the two bands were quite popular, so it promised to be a full house.</p><p>Things <a href=#>didn't exactly go well</a>. Once fans realized that instead of the crunchy jams of Phish, they would be treated to some comedy sketches, they began to chuck shoes at the group. Kelly implored the crowd to relax and let them do their craft, which was met with a volley of lighters from the crowd. Knowing Phish's reputation for having a weed-friendly audience, the disposal of so many lighters demonstrates just how furious they were at having to suffer through a <a href=#>comedian</a> while waiting for their favorite band to come out. Cook and his group retreated backstage, and the show went on without them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lGppam9fqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2Zrq%2BxjJymqKNf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-masked-singer-uk-season-four-celebrity-contestants-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>The Masked Singer: Which celebrity contestants have been revealed so far?</span></a>
