Here’s what she had to say…
On the message of “Have Mercy”: “It was definitely a response to what everyone has said about me whether good or bad, and it’s me taking back my body and just finding all of the beautiful things about it and feeling confident…it took us like less than an hour and everything we talked about was how people see me in this different light, and now they may not understand me, but it’s all right."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

You know, something that she continues to remind me of is to trust my gut and my instinct and my voice and what I love is that she’s always asking me, what do you want to do? And even before she even gives me her advice, she’d be like, what do you want? And then I’m like, well, what do you think? Because she has so much expertise and she’s been exactly where I’ve been and anything she says honestly I’ll listen to. I think anyone will, I mean it’s <strong>Queen B</strong>.”</p><p><strong>On what being at the Met Gala is really like:</strong> “I was happy that my sister [<a href=# title="Halle Bailey"><strong>Halle</strong></a>] and I were going together because regardless if we didn’t know anyone, we had each other. We actually got in there and it was the most chill event. I was thoroughly surprised. I think none of us could have a plus one. So it was everyone there just being themselves, they’re all comfortable, there are no cameras, you don’t have to worry about anything. No one’s, like, thinking about how they’re looking, we’re just having a great time and I had so much fun….you would think you’d feel so many egos and it’d be weird energy. No. It was the complete opposite and <a href=# title="Justin Bieber"><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> performed, and he was even sitting right next to me at my table. He’s so sweet. There’s so many people I met that night who I’m fans of, and they were just really chill. Like, I think that was one of my favorite events I’ve been to.”</p><p>Check out the full episode down below!</p><p><strong>Chloe</strong> also recently made headlines for her amazing performance at an awards show. <a href=#>Check it out!</a></p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5ihvKZ5wZqgpZ2pYr%2BmwsSao6xlp52utXnToZxmpZWpeqity5pknrCgmr%2Bqsc2cnGaho2K%2Fpq3LpbBmpJmgsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlize-theron-beaded-net-skirt-thong-sandal-dior-show.html><span>←</span><span>Charlize Theron Is a Total Blonde Bombshell in a Beaded See-Through Skirt</span></a>
