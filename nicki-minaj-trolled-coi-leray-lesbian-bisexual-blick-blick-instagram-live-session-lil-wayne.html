On similar lines, she again got back to the business when she asked her new rapper friend Coi Leray if she was lesbian or if she was bisexual. Soon, the Internet trolled Nicki for interfering in other's businesses but also wondered if <a href=# rel>Coi Leray</a> was actually gay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Social media users without wasting any time thronged to Twitter after the two female emcees interacted on Instagram Live hours after the release of their first-ever collaboration called ‘Blick Blick’. <a href=#>Coi Leray</a> quickly grabbed one of the top trending spots on the micro-blogging site as fans trolled her over her sexuality. <a href=# rel>Coi Leray</a> and <a href=#>Nicki Minaj’s</a> song ‘Blick Blick’ was released on Friday, March 19 and it came after the latter had first canceled her verse but later decided to rejoin.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong><br><a href=# rel>‘Blick Blick’: Nicki Minaj rejoins Coi Leray after canceling verse, trolls say song 'tanked'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Rolling Ray accuses Coi Leray of stealing his 'prrr', Internet trolls them for arguing over 'noise from a cat'</a></p><h2 class=split>Is Coi Leray gay?</h2><p>Nicki Minaj during the Live <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> session decided to check on Coi Leray’ sexual preferences asking if she was a lesbian. To this, Coi simply denied saying, “No, I like d**k.” Getting more curious, Nicki then popped another question asking if the Boston rapper was bisexual. The 24-year-old rapper denied that too but confessed having a sexual relationship with a woman. “No, I eat pu**y before though. It just wasn’t for me”, said Coi.<br>&nbsp;<br>She continued, “After I was in it, that’s when I realized. I was like, listen, this is not for me. This is not my type of thing.” Clearing the air on the matter, the ‘No More Parties’ hitmaker said she liked men when it came to sexual partners. “You know what it is, I like a man’s touch. I like aggression so a girl can’t really give me that aggression”, said Coi Leray. Nick then asked if she found Young M.A. aggressive enough to which Coi responded saying she rather date a boy. She continued, “My s**t looks a little, I guess, lesbian or tomboy or dykish or whatever they wanna call it.” She concluded, “Maybe one day I’ll meet a girl in the future and she’ll change my mind. It don’t turn me on right now but just maybe, I don’t know.”</p><p>In July 2021, Nicki got trolled after she asked Lil Wayne about his favorite sex position. Starting on a very direct note, Wayne said, “On top, on top in all positions (in life) not just sex or in bed. When you are on top, you can ask the other to stop moving.” Nicki giggled throughout and interrupted him by saying, “If the legs don’t go all the way up, then you ain’t doing it right.” Wayne continued, “I like it when we lay down and she could look at me just to see the power she has over me at such a moment. I ain’t humping back. When I am on top - I am a powerful mother****r.”<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>‘Nicki Minaj be in everybody business’</h2><p>Social media users quickly got to their job of trolling the two as one of the users stated, “Nicki Minaj b in everybody business! now why is she on live asking coi leray is she gay.” Another, on similar lines, asserted, “Girl Nicki are you curious of the younger generations sexuality or something girllll weirding her out. I hope Coi ain't creeped out.” One shared, “Why she always asking people about their sexualities, like girl.” &nbsp;Whereas, one posted, “Nicki asked Coi Leray is she’s gay, when she said no, she asked if she’s bi lmao. I feel you cause it gotta be SUM.”<br>&nbsp;<br>The next one tweeted, “LMFAO Nicki was so confused when Coi said she realized she didn’t like women AFTER TRYING IT.” Another stated, “I feel like she was going say Megan.” One user said, “Dang I thought she was lesbian.” One individual said, “Ewww that's way to much info shorty could kept that to herself lol”, as another&nbsp; mentioned, “She really pretty but coi dress like a lesbian..thats why I think nicki ask her that.” And, one concluded, “Y'all reaching. Coi is probably trying to find the right words to say she likes d*** without sounding homophobic. And it is just a normal conversation. I mean it's obvious there were people who assumed Coi fish in the ladies pond, n now that it's clear, lesbians will respect her!”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>nicki minaj b in everybody business! now why is she on live asking coi leray is she gay😭😭😭</p>— THE PRETTIEST.✨ (@carnijaay) <a href=#>March 19, 2022</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Girl Nicki are you curious of the younger generations sexuality or something girllll weirding her out.
