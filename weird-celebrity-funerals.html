Carrie Fisher is known in equal parts for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise and for her cunning wit and humor. That sense of humor didn’t die with her in 2016, though. As Vanity Fair reported at the time, when Fisher was buried alongside her mother, Debbie Reynolds, in January 2017, she was buried in a large Prozac pill-shaped urn."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That sense of humor didn’t die with her in 2016, though.</p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> reported at the time, when Fisher was buried alongside her mother, Debbie Reynolds, in January 2017, she was buried in a large Prozac pill-shaped urn.</p><p>“It was a porcelain antique Prozac pill from the ’50s that was one of Carrie’s prized possessions,” her brother Todd Fisher said.</p><p>Fisher had long been open about her own bipolar disorder and advocated throughout her life for mental health awareness. She had also had a morbid sense of humor about her death years before it came.</p><p>In her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking, she wrote about how George Lucas instructed her not to wear a bra when playing Princess Leia “because there’s no underwear in space.” She mused:</p><p>“What happens is you go to space and you become weightless. So far so good, right? But then your body expands??? But your bra doesn’t—so you get strangled by your own bra. Now I think that this would make for a fantastic obit—so I tell my younger friends that no matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.”</p><p>The sight of her brother carrying her ashes in that Prozac-shaped urn likely would have amused the late star. Indeed, speaking to the <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a>, Todd said the urn “was where she would want to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4scirm2ablaGyo77IrbBmnqWjsrOty6xmbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candice-swanepoel-bikini-ass-photoshoot.html><span>←</span><span> Candice Swanepoel: In Your Face, Darwin!!</span></a>
