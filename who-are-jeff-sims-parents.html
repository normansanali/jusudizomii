His role as the team’s starting quarterback began during his sophomore year.</p><p>While initially aspiring to join the Miami Hurricanes’ college football team, his dream was not reciprocated by the Hurricanes. Instead, he gravitated towards the Florida State Seminoles, under the leadership of then-head coach Willie Taggart.</p><p>In February 2019, he pledged his commitment to Florida State, envisioning himself as a backup quarterback to James Blackman. During that year, he showcased his skills in the Elite 11 quarterback competition. However, on December 11, following Florida State’s coaching changes with Taggart’s departure and Mike Norvell’s appointment as the new head coach, Sims withdrew his commitment to Florida State.</p><p>Subsequently, on December 18, he officially signed with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Sims had garnered offers from numerous schools in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, including Florida State, Georgia Tech, and the Maryland Terrapins. 247Sports.com ranked him as the number 10 dual-threat quarterback in the nation and the number 223 recruit overall. In January 2020, he was on record to have showcased his talent in the Under Armour All-America Game, an all-star high school football event.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Jeff Sims</a> has a familial connection to football, as his uncle, Mike Sims-Walker, formerly played in the National Football League for the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>After the conclusion of the 2019 season, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets underwent changes in their quarterback roster, which left the position open for competition. Sims, alongside Tucker Gleason, James Graham, and Jordan Yates, contended for the coveted role during the offseason. Graham and Sims emerged as the frontrunners, although the team remained tight-lipped regarding the starting quarterback prior to the season’s commencement.</p><p>On September 11, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution unveiled Jeff Sims as the team’s starting quarterback. He made his collegiate debut on September 12, leading the Yellow Jackets to a remarkable 16–13 victory against the Florida State Seminoles at Doak Campbell Stadium. Sims impressed with his performance, completing 24 of 35 passes for 277 yards and amassing 64 rushing yards.</p><p>This achievement established Jeff Sims as the first true freshman quarterback to start a season opener for the Yellow Jackets since Reggie Ball in 2003, marking a historic win. His stellar debut earned him the recognition of Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Week, 247Sports.com’s True Freshman of the Week, and mentions in the weekly lists of the Davey O’Brien Award and the Manning Award. Following his debut, the Yellow Jackets faced two losses, falling 49–21 to the UCF Knights and 37–20 to the Syracuse Orange, with Sims facing adversity in the latter game due to four interceptions.</p><p>Jeff Sims displayed improvement in his sophomore campaign, throwing for 1,468 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions, while also contributing 372 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns in 5 starts. However, he shared the starting quarterback role with freshman Jordan Yates, and the Yellow Jackets concluded the season with a 3-9 record, missing out on bowl eligibility once again.</p><p>On December 18, 2022, Sims disclosed his commitment to the Nebraska Cornhuskers, marking a new chapter in his college football journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Jeff Sims’ Parents?</h2><p>Details about his parents are not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWRp7JutsSfnWarmaLAbrzAq5ynrKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-we-know-about-joan-landon-school-admin-on-the-golden-bachelor-already-turning-heads.html><span>←</span><span>What We Know About Joan: Landon School Admin On The 'Golden Bachelor' Already Turning Heads</span></a>
