We prayed for this moment and wanted to hold on to it as long as we could. The past few months have been life-changing in the best ways possible.”</p><p>The MTV personality went on to gush about her and <a href=#><strong>Cory Wharton</strong></a>’s 3-year-old daughter’s response to the news, writing, “Ryder is so excited to be a big sister again and is already super protective over my bump. She prays for the baby every night and kisses my belly every morning. Zach, you have been nothing but supportive and there every step of the way. Thinking about how young we were when we first met and how far we have come, I could not be more proud of us today. My heart is so full. Let the next adventure began.”</p><p>Ryder first became a big sister in April 2020 when Wharton, 29, and his girlfriend, <strong>Taylor Selfridge</strong>, <a href=#>welcomed their daughter, Mila</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to <a href=#>coparenting</a>, Floyd exclusively told Us Weekly in June 2019 that the Michigan native was “stricter” with Ryder.</p><p>“I’m more like, ‘Come on.
