Collectors all over the world are constantly seeking rare and valuable pieces to add to their collections, and some of these items can fetch millions of dollars at auction. However, when it comes to the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia, there is one item that stands above all others: the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card.</p><p>This iconic card is part of the first Topps set ever produced and features a young Mickey Mantle in his early years with the New York Yankees. The card is in mint condition, which is extremely rare for a card that is over 70 years old. It was sold at auction for a record-breaking $12.5 million in August of 2021, making it the most expensive piece of sports <a href=#>memorabilia</a> ever sold.</p><p>The value of sports memorabilia has been on the rise for many years, but the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a surge in sales. With people stuck at home and unable to attend live events, collectors turned to online marketplaces like eBay to add to their collections. This led to a 142% increase in sales of sports memorabilia on eBay during the pandemic, including items like autographed jerseys, game-used equipment, and rare cards like the 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle.</p><p>However, the sports memorabilia market is not without its risks. The value of these items can fluctuate rapidly, and potential turbulence looms over the market after Topps was sold to Fanatics. It is unclear how this will impact the <a href=#>collector’s</a> market, but it is likely that prices will continue to rise for rare and valuable pieces.</p><p>Despite the risks, there are many passionate collectors out there who are willing to pay top dollar for a piece of sports history. One such collector is Brandon Steiner, who has developed a passion for collecting sports memorabilia from a young age. Steiner's collection includes items from iconic athletes like Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth, and Muhammad Ali.&nbsp;</p><p>Steiner's appreciation for the history and significance of each piece is evident in the way he talks about his collection. He sees each item as a piece of history, a tangible connection to the athletes and moments that have shaped the world of sports. Steiner has also been successful in the sports <a href=#>memorabilia</a> industry, founding Steiner Sports in 1987 and building it into a multimillion-dollar business.</p><p>But Steiner's impact on the industry goes beyond business success. He has also used his platform to give back to the community, working with organizations like the Make-A-Wish Foundation and donating a portion of his proceeds to various charities. Through his passion for collecting sports memorabilia, Steiner has made a positive impact on the lives of many people.</p><p>In conclusion, sports memorabilia is a world filled with passion, history, and value. The 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle baseball card may currently hold the title of the most expensive piece of sports <a href=#>memorabilia</a> ever sold, but the market is constantly evolving and changing. However, one thing remains constant: the passion and dedication of collectors like Brandon Steiner, who see each item as a piece of history and a connection to the world of sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSmp6OpeqbEz56lrKGmmnqxtcScnGanlmLAsbvRrWSmnZ2kv6KuyKWgmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./teva-zymic-sandal-review.html><span>←</span><span>Teva Sandals Are So Comfortable, I Feel Barefoot Wearing Them</span></a>
