Her father is a pastor while her mother was a tennis player at Wimbledon, but later teamed up with her husband to start a church in Vancouver.</span></p><p><span>Apart from her Canadian nationality, Melissa is also an American national, her father being from Chicago.</span></p><h2><strong><span>5 things you need to know about the actress</span></strong></h2><h4><strong><span>1. Movie Credits</span></strong></h4><p><span>Fresh out of high school, Melissa Roxburgh knew what career she wanted to pursue so she hired an agent and it wasn’t long before she landed her first role.&nbsp;Her first notable film credit was in Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, where she was cast as Rachel in 2011, and she followed the following year with a different role in the sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Dog Days – this time she was cast as Heather Hills.</span></p><p>She has also had significant roles in several other films including&nbsp;<span>Big Time Movie</span><span>&nbsp;as Princess (2012),&nbsp;</span><span>Leprechaun: Origins</span><span>&nbsp;as Jeni (2014),&nbsp;</span><span>The Marine 4: Moving Target</span><span>&nbsp;as Loivia Tanis (2015),&nbsp;</span><span>Star Trek Beyond</span><span>&nbsp;as Ensign Syl (2016), as well as&nbsp;</span><span>Loss of Comfort</span><span>&nbsp;as Azaria, also in 2016.</span></p><h4><strong><span>2. Television career</span></strong></h4><p><span>She’s also built a strong television career, starting with the Supernatural spinoff&nbsp;</span><span>Bloodlines</span><span>&nbsp;as Violet Duval in 2014. The CW network, however, failed to pick up the show which ultimately only not been broadcast.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Melissa Roxburgh landed the lead role in another CW show titled&nbsp;</span><span>Valor</span><span>.&nbsp;Her role as Thea on Valor lasted from 2017 to 2018 before the show was canceled, just after one season and 13 episodes.&nbsp;The cancellation didn’t spell Melissa’s death, but did allow her to fulfill her current role as Michaela Stone on Manifest;&nbsp;she has remained on the show to this day.</span></p><p>The actress can be credited with other television appearances.&nbsp;<span>People of Tomorrow</span><span>&nbsp;where she played Talia in one episode,&nbsp;</span><span>Legends of Tomorrow</span><span>&nbsp;as Betty Seaver (one episode),&nbsp;</span><span>Travelers</span><span>&nbsp;as Carrie, and&nbsp;</span><span>Sorority Murder</span><span>&nbsp;as Carly (TV movie).</span></p><h4><strong><span>3. She would have been a journalist</span></strong></h4><p><span>Before landing a spot on the hit series Manifest, Melissa Roxburgh took classes in the communications department at Simon Fraser University.&nbsp;His plan at the time was to pursue a career as a journalist.&nbsp;That aspiration must have been gutted when she cast Manifest, though we can’t entirely rule out the possibility of seeing her in the journalism profession in the future.</span></p><h4><strong><span>4. His net worth</span></strong></h4><p><span>Still building her career to achieve great things Melissa hasn’t amassed much wealth yet, but she’s surely a millionaire if various reports of her having a million dollars in net worth are to be believed.</span></p><h4><strong><span>5. Height and other trivial facts</span></strong></h4><p><span>Melissa Roxburgh is 5ft 5in and weighs a perfect 52kg to go with her.&nbsp;She loves to travel a lot, a passion she developed growing up in a family that went to different places to do missionary work.&nbsp;They went to different places, including Africa, Albania and Guatemala.&nbsp;These trips sparked Melissa’s interest in social justice issues.&nbsp;To support this cause, she is responsible for the generic division of the International Rescue Committee (IRC).&nbsp;The committee is designed to help those in serious humanitarian crises.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGillaG2tL%2FAZqmosJKqv6i0jJugqGVlYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6r7HEnWStp12gu7DDjJqZqK2kYsGpsYyamq2qlajAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lina-lazaar.html><span>←</span><span>Lina Lazaar Wiki, Age, Net worth (Hassan Jameels Ex-Wife) Bio, Family</span></a>
