He is considered to be one of the OG YouTubers and one of the first to rise to influencer status from the website. His real name is King Russel, and fans were shocked when he deleted all of his old videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans loved the numerous content he created, but any and all traces of the old Kingsley have been removed from YouTube. He decided that for his mental health he needed to take a break from being in the public eye.

Some also took issue with a makeup tutorial Marbles shared years ago, claiming it contained an image of Marbles in black face.
