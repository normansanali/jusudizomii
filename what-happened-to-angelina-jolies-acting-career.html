This has many wondering how much gas the actress has left in the tank.</p><p>Let's take a look at Jolie's output slowing down, what she has said about walking away from acting, and if she will be walking away for good, or simply pick things up again.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-is-one-of-hollywood-39-s-most-famous-actresses-who-once-had-a-prolific-film-output>Angelina Jolie Is One Of Hollywood's Most Famous Actresses, Who Once Had A Prolific Film Output</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maleficent-2.jpg><p>Angelina Jolie, an actress renowned for her extraordinary talent and humanitarian efforts, has left an indelible mark on Hollywood and the world. With a career spanning several decades, she has not only become one of the most celebrated actresses but also an inspiration to many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout her career, Jolie has portrayed a wide range of complex characters in both mainstream and independent films. Characters like Lara Croft, Marianne Pearl, and Maleficent are all standouts from her career, which is truly saying something.</p><p>Even outside the realm of acting and humanitarian work, Angelina Jolie's name continues to resonate. Her films have achieved considerable success in syndication, becoming timeless classics that appeal to new generations. Movies like Girl, Interrupted, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and Maleficent continue to captivate audiences on television and streaming platforms worldwide.</p><p>For many years, Jolie seemed to have a prolific output. She was seemingly everywhere, and studios were champing at the bit to get her involved in their biggest films. This helped the actress land premiere projects, many of which became successful at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In more recent years, however, things have slowed down for Jolie. This had fans speculating as to why, and in an interview, she finally shed light on what's been going on.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/angelina-jolie-spends-time-with-son-pax-after-embarrassing-wardrobe-malfunction-at-the-rome-film-festival.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Angelina Jolie Spends Time With Son Pax After Embarrassing Wardrobe Malfunction At The Rome Film Festival</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The actress looked flawless in NYC recently, unlike in newly resurfaced footage from a Rome appearance.</span><h2 id=angelina-jolie-has-slowed-down-and-said-that-she-has-not-felt-like-herself-in-a-decade>Angelina Jolie Has Slowed Down, And Said That She Has Not Felt Like Herself In A Decade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-tourist.jpg><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Jolie said, "Now I wonder if I don't know what my style is because I'm still understanding who I am at 48. I guess I'm in transition as a person. I feel a bit down these days. I don't feel like I've been myself for a decade, in a way, which I don't want to get into. We had a lot of healing to do. We're still finding our jogging."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This statement certainly caught people's attention, as Jolie has been in the midst of a number of difficulties in her personal life. These could certainly play a part in why she has not been herself, as she said.</p><p>The star, however, has shifted her focus.</p><p>"I think part of [Atelier Jolie] has also been therapeutic for me—to work in a creative space with people you trust and to rediscover yourself. I'm hoping to change many aspects of my life. And this is the forward-facing one," she continued.</p><p>As much as fans would love to see the actress in more projects, it's clear that she is doing what she feels is best, and that is to be applauded.</p><p>Things have slowed down for Jolie, but she has a few projects in the works.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/brad-pitt-worried-for-daughter-vivienne-s-well-being-after-angelina-jolie-hires-her-as-broadway-assistant.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brad Pitt “Worried’ For Daughter Vivienne’s Well-Being After Angelina Jolie Hires Her As Broadway Assistant</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brad believes Angelina has an ulterior motive for letting their youngest daughter work on the production.</span><h2 id=angelina-jolie-has-multiple-projects-in-the-works>Angelina Jolie Has Multiple Projects In The Works</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jolie-those-who-wish-me-dead.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> page, Jolie has some interesting projects on tap.</p><p>One of the most notable projects is Kung Fu Panda 4, which is listed as in production.</p><p>Jolie previously spoke about doing animated films, which is something she enjoys.</p><p>"Doing an animated movie [where you’re just providing the voice] is a very different process than doing the ones where you are actually in front of the camera. I love it. I’ve heard some people don’t, but I think it’s the greatest thing. Maybe if that’s all you did you’d feel restricted and like you also had other things to share, but for me, it’s great – you get stripped of so many things and you are just using your voice. So as an artist you think differently about how you approach it, how you communicate with just one part of your instrument. So it’s all very interesting, you know?" she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elsewhere on her IMDb, Jolie is attached to projects like Every Note Played, Maleficent 3, and Maria. Each of those projects are listed as being in pre-production, and with the SAG strike still going on, fans will be keeping a close eye on how those shake out.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/angelina-jolie-s-tattoo-artist-apologizes-after-she-reveals-new-ink-dissing-ex-brad-pitt.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Angelina Jolie’s Tattoo Artist Apologizes After She Reveals New Ink That Fans Think Is A Diss To Brad Pitt</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Angelain's new ink has caused a stir online as some fans think they've uncovered a secret meaning.</span><p>Not feeling like herself has kept Angelina Jolie from a more prolific output, but with multiple projects on deck, here's hoping that things are improving.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq3NoJyloZ6Wequ7y6KcrGWRmMGqusZmmpqqlZq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vineet-raina-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-511851-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vineet Raina Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
