Tim founded the organization in 2013 after having served 12 years as a U.S. Special Agent for the Department of Homeland Security. He actually quit his job as a special agent to be on a mission to rescue children from cartels and human traffickers in Latin America. And indeed his deeds have paid off in ways he cannot imagine.

Let us tell you more about it and more about him in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Who Plays Tim Ballard In The Movie Song of Freedom?</strong></h3><p>So, the movie&nbsp;Song of Freedom Tim Ballard is based on Tim Ballard’s true story of devoting himself to fighting child sex trafficking.</p><p>The film is sold as a conservative thriller and it stars Jim Caviezel as Tim Ballard in the lead role. Sporting a trim dark beard and coppery blond hair, the actor portrays Tim.</p><p>Jim, they say, has been a go-to actor for the kind of faith-based projects for the past 19 years since him playing&nbsp;the title role in Mel Gibsons’s The Passion of the Christ.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Tim Ballard’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Tim Ballard reportedly enjoyed an estimated $2 million and plus net worth as of July 2023.</p><p>In addition to shining a light worldwide on the global epidemic of child sex trafficking, Tim has also been the CEO of The Nazarene Fund since November 2017.

So, how have they been in recent times? Still, married or not? Here’s what we know.</p><p>Tim and his wife have been actually inseparable since meeting for the first time in 1999 at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Just on 25 April 2023, they celebrated their 23rd anniversary.</p><p>What’s more, the couple also is proud parents of nine amazing kids. Two of them (son Colin and daughter Coline) have been adopted. They were apparently rescued by Tim from traffickers while he was on a sting operation in Haiti.</p><p>The couple’s nine children ranged from ages 23 to 6 as of June 2023.</p><p>Their son Blain Ballard is a volunteer at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Previously, he went to Westlake High School in Utah. Back in May 2019, his parents were super proud that he was called to serve a 2-year church mission in Quito, Ecuador. “It’s a blessing to be his father!!!”, Tim told back then.</p><p>The other son is much younger Daniel.
