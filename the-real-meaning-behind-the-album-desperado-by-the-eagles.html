Glenn Frey reportedly even began singing a line or two. The song failed to materialize, but it did inspire what would become the album “Desperado” and its title track. Specifically, Frey directed the band members to write songs about the individual gang members, or about the concept of an Old West Outlaw gang generally, and tie it in to The Eagles themselves. In other words, “Desperado” (the album), with its Old West and cowboy references throughout the songs it contained, was intended to solidify the image of the men who made up The Eagles as outlaws themselves; or as <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>‘ Penelope Ross put it, “a group of musicians, who by their choice of careers, also become outcasts from society.”</p><p dir=ltr>Fellow Eagle Bernie Leadon was clear that Frey might have been reaching, but regardless, it worked. “It’s a little bit of a thin premise, the outlaw gang compared to the modern rock ‘n’ roll band, but then so are most Hollywood movies,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybr7EmqNmpZWWu6q6xmaZnqCZo7FuwMeeZJqkkqq6brDErKeeqpGZvG6u2GaroZ1dmq6ouMSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geforce-rtx-2070-super-rtx-2060-super-review.html><span>←</span><span>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super &amp;amp; RTX 2060 Super Review: Smaller Numbers, Bigger Performance</span></a>
