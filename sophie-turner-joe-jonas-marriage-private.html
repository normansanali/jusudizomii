He ended up livestreaming the event on his Instagram, making it accessible for fans all across the Internet. Earlier this week, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a27649808/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-diplo-ruined-wedding/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe said" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Joe said</a> the producer "did ruin" the ceremony by sharing it all on the 'gram, but added that he and Sophie "laughed" over the social media faux pas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking to Porter, Turner proved she was ultimately a good sport about the leak. "It would have been better if no one had known, but I actually think it was funny," she said. Personally, the actress would've tried to keep the ceremony hush-hush for a bit longer. "Maybe not forever," she explained. "I think at some point I would have had to stop saying 'fiancé,' but yes, I would have kept it a secret."</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turner continued on a strong note: "Marriage is a private thing between two people and I think that’s how it should always be. It’s not about the dress, it’s not about the food. It’s about being husband and wife, and being dedicated to each other forever."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She and Joe are expected to have a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25378554/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-wedding-date-venue-guest-details/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bigger wedding ceremony" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">bigger wedding ceremony</a> this year, with reports saying it'll take place in France this summer. Turner, staying true to her word, kept mum about the rumored celebration. When asked if the second wedding was still on, she simply said, "I don’t know."</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt="Dress, Black-and-white, Gown, Style, " title="Dress, Black-and-white, Gown, Style, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bazbride-link-clicktojoin-1-1557949124.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">.</span></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
