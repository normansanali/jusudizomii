Although Karen said Kris is “generous and giving,” she acknowledged the real point of the gifts was to keep her from talking.</p><p>Unfortunately for Kris, Karen is fed up with it and is sharing details on Kris’ affairs, her relationship with Bruce and her inappropriate behavior with Scott Disick and Lamar Odom.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Natalie Zettel with Kardashians" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Natalie-Zettel-with-Kardashians.jpg alt="Natalie Zettel with Kardashians" width=490 height=490 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br>^Karen’s daughter, Natalie Zettel, with cousins Khloe and Kim Kardashian.</p><p>“[Kris and Bruce] are separated,” Karen claimed, adding Bruce has sought a lawyer. “Their relationship goes back and forth. I would love to see them get back together.”</p><p>In order for that to happen, Kris has to stay on her best behavior around her daughter’s partners.</p><p>“I’ve heard she flirts with Scott and Lamar when she’s drunk,” Karen said, indicating she hasn’t actually witnessed this.</p><p>In terms of inappropriate relationships, the biggest bombshell Karen dropped was that Kris and O.J. Simpson used to flirt before he was accused to killing her best friend. Even since then, Karen said O.J. “has been trying to contact Kris from jail,” where he is on unrelated charges.</p><p>Karen’s revelations are undeniably interesting, but the single mother may have ulterior motives. According to <a href=#>Radar Online</a>, she’s had shady dealings of her own with past partners. The most explosive relationship was that with her daughter’s father, whom Karen accused of using crystal meth and being violent.</p><p>“Karen’s relationships with such unsavory characters had to have been a major sore point with the Kardashian clan,” a family insider told <a href=#>Star Magazine</a>. “Karen means well, but bringing violent cons into their family circle has made her a bit of a black sheep — especially to Kris.”<br><br><br></p><a title="website statistics" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/8621503/0/eead5755/1/ alt="website statistics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkuLO10mahnqaemr%2B0edKiqq2domK4or7Ep2Shp6WctbW7zWapnq6Vlrm0ecqroKxlkaOxbq7RrpqeZZqau6%2Bx0WaYq51dqLKxrdGaq56cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./koduri-srisaila-sri-rajamouli-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-588115-html.html><span>←</span><span>Koduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, B</span></a>
