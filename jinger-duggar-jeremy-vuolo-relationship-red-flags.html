For years, the #FreeJinger movement hoped for "freedom" for Jinger, meaning they wanted her to leave the Duggar family compound without a husband.</p><p>Once Jinger did move away from her family home, the Free Jinger movement focused on other Duggar siblings (including Jana, the oldest non-married Duggar child as of 2024), but fans have still kept a close eye on Jinger. While Jinger has broken away from her family and their apparently stifling religious beliefs, fans are not convinced that she is truly "free."</p><p>Here is what we know about Jinger Duggar and Jeremy Vuolo's relationship timeline, including some key points where fans thought they saw red flags.
