His directing work frequently addresses issues surrounding coming out and transitioning to a gay lifestyle.</p><p>In 2018, his mother attempted to pair him up with Olympian Adam Rippon via the social media platform Twitter, which elicited a response because the two met in person during a human rights campaign in Los Angeles.
