Originally a bonus track on the UK and German&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;edition of&nbsp;Lights, the song was re-edited for inclusion on&nbsp;Bright Lights&nbsp;in late 2010, serving as the single version.</p><p>The music video for “Lights” was filmed by&nbsp;Sophie Muller&nbsp;on 21 September 2010 before the lead single from the&nbsp;Bright Lights&nbsp;re-release was changed to “Your Song”.&nbsp;It was officially released on 20 January 2011.&nbsp;The video shows Goulding dancing, playing the drums and the tambourine whilst different lighting effects including lasers surround her as she sings.</p><p>It also shows her in numerous scenes swinging different hand-held lights and torches around giving the impression of a&nbsp;light painting, whilst the camera produces a&nbsp;bullet time&nbsp;effect like those used in&nbsp;The Matrix.

The song was originally recorded by British singer Leona Lewis for her third studio album, Glassheart (2012), but it was ultimately scrapped.</p><p>Upon its release, “Burn” was met with a mixed response from music critics, who praised it as “catchy” and noted it as one of Goulding’s most radio-friendly songs to date, while others felt it was not memorable. It earned Goulding her first number-one single on the&nbsp;UK Singles Chart, selling 116,857 copies in its first week and staying atop the chart for three consecutive weeks. The track attained similar success internationally, reaching the top 10 in countries such as Australia, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and Sweden, as well as number 13 on the Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ellie-goulding-songs></span><span>Ellie Goulding Songs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Love Me Like You Do</li><li>I Need Your Love</li><li>Burn</li><li>How Long Will I Love You</li><li>Hate Me</li><li>Still Falling for You</li><li>Anything Could Happen</li><li>Lights</li><li>Slow Grenade</li><li>Starry Eyed</li><li>Power</li><li>Worry About Me</li><li>Something in the Way You Move</li><li>Sixteen</li><li>Army</li><li>Your Song</li><li>Hanging On</li><li>Explosions</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ellie-goulding-delirium></span><span>Ellie Goulding Delirium</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Delirium&nbsp;is the third studio album by English singer and songwriter&nbsp;Ellie Goulding, released on 6 November 2015 by&nbsp;Polydor Records.&nbsp;Music critics&nbsp;were generally impressed by the overall production of the record, although they were ambivalent in regards to its originality.
