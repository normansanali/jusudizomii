However, over the years there have been times when a title has been lost or stolen, causing mass panic for those involved. Anytime this happens it always gets the wrestling world talking, and it is normally a major deal.</p><h2 id=rhea-ripley-39-s-tag-team-title><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rhea Ripley's Tag Team Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rhea-ripley-nikki-ash-wwe-womens-tag-champions.jpg><p>Rhea Ripley is the latest wrestler who has fallen foul to losing their title. However, this situation wasn't her fault as she lost her suitcase while traveling with WWE in Mexico. Unfortunately, her <a href=#>Women's Tag Team Championship</a> was inside the bag, meaning that it went missing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, it wasn't found and Ripley not only lost her title but also all of her ring gear that she had with her. Because Ripley was heading to another show, she wasn't able to get any other gear, so on that night she actually had to wear Damian Priest's on that night.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-39-s-aew-world-title><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Chris Jericho's AEW World Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chris-jericho-aew.jpeg><p>Chris Jericho was <a href=#>the first-ever AEW World Champion</a>, therefore that time with the title had a lot of importance. Because the title was brand new, audiences were shocked that he lost the title just 24 hours after he had won it, which became a huge talking point in the wrestling industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Things You Didn't Know Happened On The Chris Jericho Cruise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jericho went to eat a meal at Longhorn Steakhouse, but he left his title inside a limo that was outside. The driver had to go to the airport in order to get Jericho's bag after getting the wrong one, but when Chris returned his title was gone. Luckily it ended up being found and handed to the police so he got the title back.</p><h2 id=the-rock-39-s-brahma-bull-title><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Rock's Brahma Bull Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-RocksBrahma-Bull-Title-Cropped.jpg><p>A lot of fans might not recognize this particular championship, and that's because it never actually got shown on television. However, it should have been, because WWE had planned for him to have <a href=#>his own personal title</a> in the same manner to how Steve Austin did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when WWE sent this championship to The Rock, it actually ended up being lost in the mail. Because of that he never received one and the company opted to not create another, which was a shame as this would have suited his character.</p><h2 id=bruno-sammartino-39-s-wwwf-title><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bruno Sammartino's WWWF Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bruno-Sammartino-WWF-Champion-Cropped.jpg><p>Bruno Sammartino is often considered to be <a href=#>one of the greatest champions</a> in the history of the industry. However, when he first won the WWWF Championship, he ended up having the title stolen from him, starting his title run in a manner he'd rather have forgotten.</p><p>Bruno had placed the title into a car when he was going for a meal, and someone had seen it sitting there and decided to break in and take the championship. It's a shame that someone felt like they could just take the title, but sadly that was the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pedro-morales-wwwf-title><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pedro Morales WWWF Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pedro-Morales.jpg><p>Despite the fact that Bruno Sammartino had his WWWF Championship stolen from him, it appears that Pedro Morales didn't learn the lesson from the situation.

At one point, he was able to hold the AWA World Championship, but he didn't lose it by mistake.</p><p>Instead, Hansen actually ran over the belt inside his truck on purpose, destroying the title. He did this because of a backstage fallout with the promotion, and he decided to ruin the title in order to make his point about the situation.</p><h2 id=jim-neidhart-39-s-wwe-tag-team-title><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jim Neidhart's WWE Tag Team Title</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Hart-Foundation-Tag-Team-Champions-Cropped.jpg><p>Jim Neidhart was an excellent talent and he certainly had a thrilling run as part of the tag team division.
