News</a>&nbsp;reported that Sonni Pacheco had filed for divorce from Jeremy Renner just 10 months after they wed. "Jeremy wanted out of the marriage almost as soon as he got into it," a source claimed. The insider added that Renner was concerned that Pacheco would try to gain sole custody of their daughter, Ava, so that she could take her back to Canada.</p><p dir=ltr>The actor did, indeed, find himself embroiled in <a href=#>a bitter custody battle</a>. In legal documents obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a> in 2019, Pacheco accused Renner of verbal and emotional abuse and of having substance use issues. She further alleged that he spoke about killing her and taking his own life. According to <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Pacheco additionally claimed that Renner left a bite mark on their daughter's shoulder, but Renner said that the mark was caused by Ava's skin getting "pinched" by her seatbelt.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Renner made allegations of his own, claiming that Pacheco sent nude photos of the actor to the evaluator working on their custody case in a bid to embarrass him, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>. He also alleged that his ex is the one who excessively uses drugs.&nbsp;Both parties have categorically denied the accusations lobbed at each other, and Renner has explained why he doesn't want to address the custody case outside the courtroom. "It only empowers it," he told Men's Health in 2021, adding, "If you respond to it, you give it gas. I don't fuel s*** fires. I just don't do it."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
