<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Be Quiet! Dark Power Pro 10 650W &amp;amp; 850W PSU Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The conclusion of a review testing two products of the same series should have been uncomplicated and straightforward. Normally, such units would&nbsp;<span>share the same number of features and similar characteristics;&nbsp;h</span>owever, the Dark Power Pro 10 series is a clear exception to that hypothesis. Besides their visual similarities, the 650W and 850W versions are nothing alike.</p><p>Both units are externally similar, sharing the same visual modifications that create a neat, high quality appearance. They are among the best-designed PSUs that we have seen to this date. On the inside however, the two units that we have tested today are entirely different. The 650W version is based on a platform from Fortron-Source (FSP), while the 850W version is a modified Seasonic XP platform. Both versions perform well enough to meet the manufacturer's specifications but the 850W unit greatly outclasses the FSP-based version on all fronts. Ironically, the Seasonic XP platform is a design that is over three years old and still has little competition when it comes to overall performance.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8952/BQDPP10_07_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>be quiet! is a company focused on creating low noise products and markets their flagship Dark Power Pro 10 series as the "world’s quietest PSUs in the high performance category". The "world's quietest" part is pushing it a little, but both units displayed a good balance between thermal performance and acoustics. However, the more efficient 850W version outperforms the 650W unit, being capable of running at lower temperatures and generating significantly lower noise levels, even at higher loads. Nevertheless, both of the Dark Power Pro 10 PSUs delivered well and their difference on acoustics was expected from just their power output and efficiency specifications.</p><p>When it comes to electrical performance and specifically to the output power quality, the 850W version severely outclasses the less powerful unit. The Dark Power Pro 10 650W PSU delivered good electrical performance and power quality, well within the design guide limits, yet it's not what we would consider acceptable for a flagship product with such a price tag. On the other hand, the 850W version performed much better, delivering three times better power quality, much stronger voltage regulation, and higher conversion efficiency.</p><p>As far as build quality goes, most enthusiasts would (rightfully) argue that the Seasonic-based unit should be better. After all, Seasonic does have a better reputation than FSP when it comes to quality. However, this is not the case here, as both units are on equal footing as far as the build quality goes. The soldering and assembly of either unit is excellent, without any flaws that we could find.</p><p>Moving over to the internal components, the only noteworthy difference is the presence of the CapXon polymer capacitors in the 650W version, while the 850W unit is using Japanese capacitors all around. CapXon is a fairly reputable company and their polymer capacitors are among the best worldwide, but be quiet! should be bragging about using "premier quality Japanese capacitors" only in the features list of their 850W Dark Power Pro 10 PSU.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/8952/BQDPP10_15_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We found the Dark Power Pro 10 650W unit <a href=#>retailing for $180</a> at the time of this review, while the 850W version can be found <a href=#>selling for $240</a>. Both price tags are very steep, especially when you consider that the Seasonic XP2 860W PSU can be <a href=#>bought for $165</a>. Nevertheless, the 850W unit still has some potential, especially for people that care about the appearance and the cooling fan of their units.&nbsp;On the other hand, the 650W version is severely overpriced and its marketing potential seems very limited, particularly for the North American market. For example, the Corsair AX760, a 760W 80 Plus Platinum PSU, currently retails <a href=#>for $5 less</a> than the Dark Power Pro 10 650W. The EVGA SuperNOVA 650G1, a PSU also based on a FSP platform (albeit a different one) can be found <a href=#>for just $80</a>.</p><p>Due to its unique appearance and good cooling fan, the Dark Power Pro 10 850W does have some market potential – especially in Europe where the prices of be quiet! units are lower. However, short of a massive price cut (e.g. about half the current price),&nbsp;there is no reasonable scenario where the Dark Power Pro 10 650W can become a financially interesting choice. It's not that the Dark Power Pro 10 650W is bad; however, it is greatly outclassed by the Dark Power Pro 10 850W and terribly overpriced to stand any hope in the North American market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV6gZFomZ5loaq2psCMnZiro12lvLix0Wanq6ddZn1ugpRprmZwZWXEbrzSrmSrnaaesrh7lg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./famous-interracial-couples.html><span>←</span><span>7 Famous Interracial Couples And How They Made History</span></a>
