It’s horrible</a>. If you’re losing weight, there’s nothing to it except for going to bed hungry and feeling miserable … “[Gaining weight] is the complete opposite,” he said. “You’re absolutely just losing all discipline and gorging like crazy. I need to stop it, it’s not healthy for your body. I’m in my mid-40s now, it’s going to start catching up with me if I don’t start being a little bit aware of my mortality.”</p><p>The American Psycho star would know: He’s gone to extreme measures to<a href=#> transform himself for a role</a> many times throughout the years. Bale famously lost more than 60 pounds to play Trevor Reznik in 2004’s The Machinist before getting super buff for his role as Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins six weeks later. Eight years later, in 2013, he <a href=#>gained 43 pounds</a> for American Hustle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/christian-bale.jpg><p>Bale told Fox News in December that he’s not sure he could handle another radical makeover. “<a href=#>I think I’m done</a> — you know. Everything hurts,” he said. “Everything hurts now. I’ve gotten really stout thinking if I can manage this again, and the answer is probably no.”</p><p>Vice, which follows the political career of <a href=#><strong>George W.
