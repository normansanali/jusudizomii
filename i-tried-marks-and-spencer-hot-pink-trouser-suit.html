As well as making the cut for potential <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>wedding guest outfits</a>, it would look amazing on a sunny holiday.</p><p id=en8s1vA94i data-wc=42>The tailored waistcoat is cut to a flattering longline shape with a belt to cinch you in at the waist and features two side pockets, while the trousers have a cool wide-leg silhouette and a subtle side zip for a sleek finish.</p><p id=efbSIn_fLe data-wc=34>Available in UK sizes 6-24, and petite to long, they retail for £45 and £35 respectively. A bargain if you ask me as the quality feels great and the whole outfit is so comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p id=egbhL1xhKX data-wc=30>If you're looking for something statement and stylish that you can still eat and drink all day in without having to think about adjusting, this trouser suit would be ideal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/822e8b4c1131-hollie-pink-coord.jpg><p id=eY4shT4QUs data-wc=67>Unsurprisingly there weren't many sizes left in stock in store (even in their London flagship), so I'm usually an 8 but pictured here wearing the waistcoat in a size 10, and it's definitely a bit too oversized. Likewise the trousers fit true to size, but I could only try them in petite (I'm 5'6), so unless you want a cropped finish I'd stick to your usual length.</p><p id=eNTrr8z8LW data-wc=23>I styled them with a pair of black strappy heeled sandals, but I'd also wear them with matching pink shoes à la M&S.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehtC5WY1iX data-wc=31>I love that you can mix and match the pieces too, dressing down the trousers with a white tee and trainers or wearing the waistcoat with a pair of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>straight-leg jeans</a>.</p><p id=evMLvAp-yJC data-wc=32>If you're looking for a suit that's slightly more fitted, I've found another hot pink two-piece at Phase Eight.

That season also saw striking looks in the same shade from the likes of Prada, Loewe, Molly Goddard and Lanvin.</p><p id=eD-jy_aJUc data-wc=57>Celebrities and the street style set followed suit, with everyone from Zendaya to Kim Kardashian and Florence Pugh wearing the hue, head to toe. But it wasn't a flash in the pan, with the release of the movie in summer 2023 reigniting everyone's obsession. It seems it's here to stay and I'm not mad about it.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Trouser suits are huge for 2024 - these are the 21 suits to wear for any occasion this summer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/870962e2b0ce-stylish-suits-for-women-in-may.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Trouser suits are huge for 2024 - these are the 21 suits to wear for any occasion this summer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Trouser suits are huge for 2024 - these are the 21 suits to wear for any occasion this summer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3b47b8f8643c-wide-leg-trousers-head-2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="11 stylish strappy sandals to elevate all of your summer outfits" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f5914c8ba507-strappy-sandals-edit-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="11 stylish strappy sandals to elevate all of your summer outfits" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>11 stylish strappy sandals to elevate all of your summer outfits</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
