In 2018, she uploaded some loved-up snaps with a mystery man to Instagram who was later reported to be <a href=#>her boyfriend, fellow actor Dan Whitlam</a>.</p><p>Mackey and Whitlam continued to share romantic pictures on the social media platform including several from an idyllic getaway with friends to the south of France. While updates regarding their relationship status — whatever it may be — are scant, in 2020, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Evening Standard</a>&nbsp;reported they were still a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, you're more likely to have seen Whitlam on the stage than on screen. Per his <a href=#>Guildhall School alum bio</a>, his most notable credits are in the plays "The Government Inspector" and "All Quiet on the Western Front," with both productions staged at London's Pleasance Theatre. His bio also notes that he is 6'4", can play the saxophone and piano, and perhaps most intriguingly of all, can spit a few bars, too. And in an interview with <a href=#>London News Online</a>, Whitlam recalled how he was stabbed with a screwdriver in his teenage years while coming to the rescue of a friend who was being mugged at the time. The star actually suffered a collapsed lung due to the incident. "Looking back it seems surreal but it was the classic case of wrong place, wrong time," he told the outlet. We'd say so.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmxjan51e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5xKakmmWdlrCssdho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sacha-baron-cohen.html><span>←</span><span>The Spy Actor Sacha Baron Cohen Satirically Destroys Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg!
