Death threats, really nasty, honestly criminal stuff. And I do think it’s because at least four of us at this table have dated our co-workers,” is what Sprouse — who plays Jughead Jones in the show — said on the subject.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Casey Cott also responded by saying that the fans’ inability to differentiate between the characters and real people propels these kinds of responses. In this case, Sprouse implied how in many cases, the relationship between the characters and the actors coincided. Like, how both Sprouse and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lili Reinhart</a> — who played Jughead and Betty — were romantically involved on and off screen, potentially adding to their fans’ confusion.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>The same goes for Camilla Mendes and Charles Melton – who reportedly dated for about a year in 2018. In other words, it’s the overlapping of on-screen and off-screen chemistry amongst the characters which — as per Sprouse — has reinforced the crazy fandom and online bullying and threats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SwsLjEZqqpqp%2BqwKZ50Z6tnpmcqHq4tNhmn55lmJbAbr7EnJyirpWZeqWxwK2fZqyYp7KiwNJmqZ6ZnKHGbrrArKuyZZiku6a%2F06WwZpuinrqqusClZKyspZuzbrvVnqlmqpmrsrOwwKWcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chloe-bailey-reveals-what-the-met-gala-experience-is-really-like.html><span>←</span><span>Chloe Bailey Reveals What the Met Gala Experience Is Really Like</span></a>
