The new comic book series release date, creator, and more</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=556 data-injectable=true data-video=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Batman</strong></a> is undoubtedly one of the most in demand heroes in comics, fans just can’t get enough of the caped crusader. As a result DC has a multitude of Batman related comics all running at once in order to satisfy the reader’s appetite. We have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: the Brave and the Bold</a>, Batman/Superman, The Batman & Scooby-doo Mysteries and that’s just naming a few of the ongoing issues right now. There’s plenty of comics which is great because we won’t be getting a movie anytime soon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">considering James Gunn apparently hates the Batman films.</a></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=200 data-current-count=200 data-injectable=false>But one particular story has fans pretty excited: <strong>Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham</strong> has been generating quite the buzz. But what exactly is this new storyline? And why are fans so excited to finally read it?</p><h3 id=h-why-all-the-hype data-injectable=false>Why all the hype?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Batman-Gargoyle-of-Gotham-2.jpg><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>The Gargoyle of Gotham will be a four-issue mini series, it was pretty heavily advertised at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SDCC</a> which might explain why there is generally more buzz for this one. The story is also unique on its own as it portrays Batman in a way that he’s never been seen before.</p><h3 id=h-what-is-the-story data-injectable=false>What is the story?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Batman-Gargoyle-of-Gotham-3.jpg><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>In this story, the Dark Knight decides to “kill” Bruce Wayne and exist exclusively as his alter-ego in order to better deal with the wave of crime that is overwhelming Gotham. No secret identity and no Bruce Wayne allows the writer to give us an entirely dedicated Batman, one who appears to be a lot more brutal judging by some of the panels that have been released so far.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>What’s also pretty exciting is that the short comic run promises an entirely new rogues gallery for Batman to deal with. Batman villains are some of the best in the business, but it can get a bit boring when we’ve had him facing off against the same handful of villains for more than 80 years in most cases.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Across the four issues we’ll see Batman tracking a serial killer who’s murders seem random at first, but as they go on, we start to realize that the murders are all connected to each other as well as connected to Batman himself. Whoever this new villain is, they will hopefully be a breath of fresh air for the franchise.</p><h3 id=h-who-is-the-comic-s-creator data-injectable=false>Who is the comic’s creator?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Batman-Gargoyle-of-Gotham-4.jpg><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Yet another reason to be excited for the upcoming comic is because of who created it. Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham is both drawn and written by Rafael Grampá, an artist/writer who has been involved in the comic book scene for over a decade and a half working on the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblazer</a>. His penciling and inking is so good that it’s capable of improving the story it’s paired with in some cases and the few panels we’ve seen for this upcoming run look to be some of his best work yet.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>This new series marks Grampá’s writing debut at DC although he’s already had plenty of experience writing and illustrating with his 2008 graphic novel, Mesmo Delivery for which he won an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eisner Award.</a></p><h3 id=h-when-is-it-releasing data-injectable=false>When is it releasing?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Batman-Gargoyle-of-Gotham-5.jpg><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>The first issue for Grampá’s upcoming mini series will be available to purchase from the 12th of September. However, there is yet to be any confirmation on the release date for the other three issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1osCMoqpmmpGpuqK6jKCYq5%2Bfrrmmec6fZKCnpJ2urnnToZxmppWseqS7zKKaZpqfpLhuv8SroJ6rXaeyrbHArJxmnJGpsm6v0Z6YraeiYq6vsIympqudXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./today-savannah-guthrie-waves-goodbye-co-star-emotional-goodbye-from-nbc.html><span>←</span><span>Today's Savannah Guthrie waves goodbye to co-star following emotional departure from NBC</span></a>
