"My son, Genesis, I think is maybe trying to take Taylor out later tonight,” Keys joked about their adorable interaction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The audience camera caught Genesis in his seat as he stared at Swift and waved at her. Swift smiled and waved back at the four-year-old, who sat on his father Swizz Beatz's lap. “He’s working on it. I’m not sure how it’s gonna go, but it looks pretty good right now,” Keys added.</p><img alt="2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards – Show" title="2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards – Show" width=1024 height=765 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-alicia-keys-attend-the-2019-iheartradio-news-photo-1135882987-1552664256.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Jeff Kravitz</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later that evening, Keys and Beatz's older son, 8-year-old Egypt, also had a moment in the spotlight. As the singer performed her song “Raise a Man” at the piano for the audience, she invited "the man that I get to raise” to join her on stage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the extraordinary performance, the mother and son duo recreated her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrPj-oeQCgo" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="duel piano moment" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">duel piano moment</a> at the Grammys in February.

Keys' beautifully written caption read like a poem or song lyrics, praising her child as "full of shine" and "endless dreams."
