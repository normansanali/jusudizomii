Ashley stated,</p><p>“He told me after we married that Khloe is not his child.” He just looked at me and uttered [it] as if it were a matter of fact. ‘Well, you know Khloe isn’t really a Kardashian, don’t you?’ he asked. And I said… ‘OK,’ and that was the end of it.”</p><p>According to Ashley and Ellen, Robert was aware that Kris had cheated on him with a couple of men while they were married. Meanwhile, Kris Jenner admitted to having an affair during her marriage to Robert in her 2011 biography, Kris Jenner… And All Things Kardashian.</p><p>Following that, Khloe Kardashian resorted to Twitter to attack her father’s widow and ex-wife. Her tweet read as follows:</p><p>“You have the audacity to mention my father’s name like this!” You should be embarrassed of yourself! I’ve let a lot of things slip, but this one is particularly low… YOU ARE HORRIBLE! (Yes, you know who I’m talking about.)”</p><p>Khloe Kardashian couldn’t stop herself from asking her mother if she was adopted after hearing the news.
