The music of XXXTentacion, which frequently explores themes of despair, anxiety, and rage, vividly depicts his personal issues.</p><p>Fans took refuge in his sincerity, claiming that his works demanded empathy rather than judgment because they were a mirror reflecting his own experiences.</p><p>Meanwhile, detractors argued that his works glorified violence, making it difficult for the public to hold him accountable for his deeds.</p><p>The musical career of XXXTentacion continued in the middle of this controversy, reaching its zenith with the release of albums.</p><p>Beyond the uproar, XXXTentacion’s arrest photo highlights the complex facets of his persona.
