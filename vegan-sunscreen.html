But which one is right for you? And what are the key characteristics of vegan sunscreen that make it so different from regular sunscreen? Read on for all the information you need.</span></p><h3><b>What Makes Vegan Sunscreen Different?</b></h3><p><span>So, what is it that separates a vegan sunscreen from a non-vegan sunscreen? Well, the truth of the matter is that a lot of the traditional sunscreens you see on store shelves are not vegan-friendly. They may contain animal by-products or undergo animal testing.</span></p><p><span>Animal testing of cosmetics leads to the deaths of countless animals every year, and a lot of people are against it. It's also completely against the lifestyle of vegan people. Vegan sunscreens are a vegan-friendly alternative, crafted without the use of animal ingredients or testing.</span></p><p><span>Often, these sunscreens are considered to be more natural, harnessing the power of plant-based ingredients. But they can also contain chemicals and other powerful active ingredients to provide the same defenses and protections as standard sunscreen.</span></p><h3><b>Why Should I Use Vegan Sunscreen?</b></h3><p><span>There are a few different reasons why you might like to make use of vegan sunscreen instead of traditional sunscreen:</span></p><ul><li><span>The Vegan Lifestyle - If you’re someone who is vegan or likes to follow a vegan lifestyle, vegan sunscreen is the best option for you. It completely matches the vegan way of life and includes no animal products.</span></li><li><span>Kind to Animals - Even if you’re not vegan, you may be a big animal lover. If so, the thought of using products tested on animals may not match your lifestyle. Vegan sunscreen lets you protect your skin without the guilt associated with animal tests.</span></li><li><span>Strong Protection - Good-quality vegan sunscreen is just as protective for your skin as traditional sunscreen. It can defend you against UVA and UVB rays, fighting the signs of aging and reducing the risk of sunburns and skin cancer.</span></li><li><span>Natural Ingredients - As explained earlier on, many vegan sunscreens feature strong natural ingredients. These products are great not only to protect your skin but also to provide it with key natural nutrients from plants like aloe vera.</span></li></ul><h3><b>What Are the Most Important Features of Vegan Sunscreen?</b></h3><p><span>There are a lot of great vegan sunscreens to buy, but which one should you choose? Well, if you’re not sure where to start, here are some key factors to focus on that will help you narrow down the search.</span></p><h4><b>Ease of use</b></h4><p><span>Some vegan sunscreens are easier to apply than others. The most popular options tend to be smooth and creamy, without any excessive oiliness or greasiness. They should be easy to rub into the skin and absorb quickly without leaving any residue behind on your fingers or body.</span></p><h4><b>Protection levels</b></h4><p><span>When it comes to sunscreen, the protection level is measured using the SPF or sun protection factor system. The higher the SPF rating, the better protection you'll have. For general daily use, SPF 30 should suffice, but you may want SPF 50+ if you live in a very sunny area or if you’re planning a tropical vacation.</span></p><h4><b>Ingredients</b></h4><p><span>Check the list of ingredients on the side of every bottle of vegan sunscreen to see what they include.&nbsp; Many ingredients will be similar, but some of the top-rated vegan sunscreens include strong natural ingredients like shea butter or aloe extract to soothe and nourish the skin.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmavnZeWu26%2F1KeqnKqVmrtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-harry-jowsey-dating-now.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Jowsey Is Dating Yet Another Reality TV Personality</span></a>
