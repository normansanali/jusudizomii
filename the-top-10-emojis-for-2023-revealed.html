An Irish emoji expert has revealed the 10 most popular emojis for 2023, which he believes reflect positively on digital discourse as a whole.
In fact, the favorite emojis were overwhelmingly upbeat, according to Keith Broni, 32, the editor-in-chief of the reference site Emojipedia.
The top five were:
 Tears-of-joy or crying-with-laughter face Rolling-on-the-floor laughing face Red heart Prayer sign (to express thanks) Loudly crying emoji (used for hysterical laughter)  “The most-used emojis of 2023 were a selection of the absolute classics from the emoji keyboard,” Broni told South West News Service."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
