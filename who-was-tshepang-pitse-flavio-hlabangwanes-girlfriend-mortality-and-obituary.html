Mortality And Obituary</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Flavio Hlabangwane was facing a Life sentence for the homicide of Tshepang Pitse, according to a recent update. Who was Shepang Pitse, Flavio Hlabangwane’s girlfriend?</strong></p><p>Flavio Hlabangwane is the assassin of Tshepang Pitse, his own wife/partner. In addition, the man was judged guilty of intentional murder, thus defeating the purposes of justice. According to the sources, the woman discovered a dismembered corpse in her Soweto home’s freezer. The suspect also admitted to murdering Pitse after a heated argument.</p><p>Hlabangwane reportedly took such a drastic action after discovering Pitse’s infidelity. In a similar fashion, the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg imposed a 10-year sentence for defeating the ends of justice and a sentence of over 15 years for violating a corpse. Likewise, the sentence time and life term will run concurrently. People were horrified by the brutal murder case, and sources revealed that Pitse was buried without all of his body parts.</p><h2>Who Was Shepang Pitse, Flavio Hlabangwane’s Girlfriend?</h2><p>Falvio Hlabangwane’s fiancée was a fourth-year medical student named Tshepang Pitse. Before her brutal assassination, the couple had been together for some time, but they had already separated. According to numerous online sources, including Idol, Pitse was his cousin and wife. A woman reportedly discovered a dismembered corpse in her Soweto home’s freezer. Similarly, she slept over after their first date and discovered the grisly find while searching for food. Hlabangwane later confessed to murdering Pitse after an altercation involving her credit card.</p><p>After learning that she had deceived on him, Hlabangwane disclosed that he intended to murder her. Pitse was just 23 years old at the time of her demise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Flavio-Hlabangwane-2-1.jpg><h2>Shepang Pitse Death and Obituary</h2><p>The death of Tshepang Pitse, the cousin-turned-lover of Flavio Halbangwane, continues to generate online news headlines. When her obituary was published, everyone was devastated, including her family.</p><p>As previously stated, her partner Flavio murdered her, and he was apprehended in November 2021. His detention occurred after body parts of Tshpeng were discovered in a refrigerator at his Soweto residence. His then-new fiancée made the discovery and alerted the neighbors and police. In addition, Flavio pleaded guilty to planning Pitse’s murder after dismembering her corpse. In addition, Tshepang was interred without all of her body parts in 2022. Until the grisly discovery, investigators believed that Tshepang’s murder was connected to a ritualistic killing.</p><p>Hlabangwane wedded Tshepang at the time to gain access to her wealth. Since 2016, Flavio and Tshepang reportedly dated for three years, but the assault began in 2019. Falvio continued to deny to discuss Pitse’s body parts.</p><h2>Where Currently Is Falvio Halbangwane?</h2><p>As stated previously, Flavio Hlabangwane was given a 10-year sentence for defeating the aims of justice and a sentence of more than 15 years for disobeying a corpse. Consequently, he is presently serving his sentence in prison. Hlabangwane admitted to the murder of his cousin-turned-lover Tshepang. Flavirow was taken into custody in November of 2021.</p><p>Sources have reported Hlabangwane’s imprisonment, but additional information on his arrest case has yet to be updated.
