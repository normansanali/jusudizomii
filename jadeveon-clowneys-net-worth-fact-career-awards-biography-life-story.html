He currently plays as a defensive end for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He also won the Defensive Player of the Year honors in the Southeastern Conference. He was drafted first overall by the Houston Texans in the 2014 NFL Draft. He played for them for five seasons, making three Pro Bowls before being traded to the Seahawks prior to the 2019 season.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jadeveon-clowney-trade-official></span>Jadeveon Clowney trade official<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The NFL on Sunday approved Seattle’s trade acquiring pass rusher and 2014 first-overall draft pick Jadeveon Clowney from Houston. As known Saturday, the Texans get defensive end Jacob Martin, defensive end Barkevious Mingo and a third-round draft choice from the Seahawks. Martin has promise but is a second-year, part-time player. Seattle was likely to cut Mingo after his poor preseason, to save the team $4.1 million against its salary cap for this year. A huge upgrade for a needy defensive line without giving up a front-line player nor a top draft choice? That’s a huge steal for the Seahawks. Now comes Sunday’s good news for Seattle: The Texans are paying Clowney $7 million this year to play for the Seahawks. Terms of the trade include Houston paying a $7 million signing bonus to Clowney, who had been a holdout through the preseason. That’s to get Clowney to finally sign his tender as a franchise player so the Texans could then trade him.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-of-jadeveon></span>Early Life of Jadeveon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jadeveon was born on 14th February 1993 in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the USA as Jadeveon Davarus Clowney.
