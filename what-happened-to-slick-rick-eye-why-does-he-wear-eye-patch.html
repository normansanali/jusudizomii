Why does he wear an eye patch? Here is all the information that you need to know about the rapper.</strong></p><p>Slick Rick aka Richard Martin Lloyd Walters is an English-American rapper and record producer.</p><p>In the mid-1980s, he rose to notoriety with Doug E. Fresh & the Get Fresh Crew. “The Show” and “La Di Da Di” are regarded as early hip hop classics. “La Di Da Di” is one of history’s most sampled tunes.&nbsp;</p><p>Rick was the third artist to sign with Def Jam Records in 1986.</p><p>Slick was blinded after sustaining an injury to his right eye. The injury was caused by a broken window, and a piece of glass struck his right eye.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-slick-rick-eye><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-slick-rick-eye></span> What Happened To Slick Rick Eye?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Slick Rick’s right eye became blind as a result of an injury. A shattered window caused the accident, and a piece of glass injured his right eye.</p><p>If caught at the time of the accident, partial eyesight may have been restored.</p><p>The mishap occurred at a local hip-hop performance, where Slick had gone to hone his MC abilities. Before the event, Slick used to wear dark shades.</p><p>There were false rumors that Slick’s early drug usage was caused by the injury that caused him to wear his signature eye patch.</p><h2 id=why-does-he-wear-eye-patch><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-he-wear-eye-patch></span> Why Does He Wear Eye Patch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Slick’s eye damage, which occurred when he was just 18 months old, is the primary reason he constantly wears an eye patch.</p><p>The accident had a significant influence on his psychology, the evolution of his personal life, and, eventually, the history of hip-hop music. Slick once said that the accident left him quite bashful, which is why he chose to remain inside and create stories instead of going out to play.</p><p>Rick wore dark sunglasses or an eye patch for virtually his entire life, which may have been one of the factors that set him apart from the Bronx’s historic Hip-Hop scene.</p><p>According to him, the eye injuries he suffered drove and encouraged him to pursue artistic endeavors. His British accent, mixed with the eye patch, guaranteed that everyone who heard him rap would remember it. Most of his fans remark that they have never met a human, much alone a rapper, who resembles him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMrKOim5tiv6qvymacsp1drLW6ecOonKxlmJp6uLHAq2SesZVivaLAwqFm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sister-wives-kody-brown-meris-breakup-relationship-today.html><span>←</span><span>The Truth About Kody Brown And Meri's Messy Relationship</span></a>
