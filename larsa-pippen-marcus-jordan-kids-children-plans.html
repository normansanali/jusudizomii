Because I’m really fulfilled with my four children.” However, later in the interview, she said she would “be open to having one more child.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Larsa-Pippen-Marcus-Jordan-kids-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Larsa s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hares three sons</a> (<strong>Scotty Pippen Jr</strong>, 22, <strong>Preston Pippen</strong>, 21, and <strong>Justin Pippen</strong>, 18) and a daughter (<strong>Sophia Pippen</strong>, 14) with her ex. Marcus doesn’t have any kids – at least, not in the traditional sense. “I’ve always viewed Trophy Room as my baby,” he said, referring to his boutique sneaker store based on his father’s trophy room. “I always wanted to establish my own name, outside of being Michael Jordan’s son. So for me, Trophy Room gave me that opportunity as my business. So I’ve always nurtured it and treated it as my child.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Now obviously, that’s not the same as having an actual baby, but it’s occupied all of my time,” he said. ” “Having a child was always so far out of my mind frame… but [recently] there’s definitely thoughts.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>A week before releasing the Jun. 20 episode of Separation Anxiety, Larsa <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke with Us Weekly</a> and revealed what her kids think about her dating Marcus. ” &nbsp;“[My kids], they love Marcus,” she said. “Like, they love him and I feel like we talk about the same things. So when I’m talking to my older son Scotty about basketball, Marcus is in on the conversation. [Then when I am] talking to my son Preston about fashion, Marcus has a clothing store — he has a boutique — so he chimes in. It is just an easy fit for our family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FqZqWZoqiubrzIqaeepl2irrOv1Kxko6eima6vecqim6xlk522rbDRnqVmqJyWu7R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-2-butanol-polar.html><span>←</span><span>Is 2 butanol polar</span></a>
