Xiaomi’s Mi 11 with the same chip showcases much better performance (we’ll have a review of that device soon), so it’s an area of improvement which could very well be achieved with future firmware updates.</p><p>For the Exynos S21, it’s a large generational boost for Samsung, however the absolute numbers are still lagging behind Snapdragon 865 devices. This is important to note for devices such as the S21+ - the S20 FE 5G actually features a Snapdragon 865 SoC in traditional Exynos markets, and if gaming performance is an important aspect for your, that device might be the more interesting purchase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53gJdxZq2glWLAornSrqWgZZeWuaLE2Gaqa2ldqrm1vsBmqmtpXaeyt7XEsGZs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dorothy-herman-net-worth-50414.html><span>←</span><span>Dorothy Herman Net Worth 2024</span></a>
