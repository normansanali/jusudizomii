<a href=../../../../the-red-magic-3-review.html></a>
Display Measurement The Red Magic 3 features a 2340 x 1080 6.65” OLED screen. At this screen size, the resolution is certainly quite stretched, however for a gaming phone I don’t think that’s too much of a priority, and the 90Hz refresh of the panel certainly makes up for it.
The phone’s software settings are very basic, there’s just a toggle between a Display P3 gamut target and an sRGB target.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dr. Ahmed Abdullah, MD Fargo, ND</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

The Indiana Jones franchise is by all accounts one of the most delectable collections of icon-worthy nuances in pop culture, from John Williams’ unforgettable score, to that hair-raising whip sound effect, via “snakes… why’d it have to be snakes?”; George Lucas’ second most prominent franchise has more than its fair share of claims to fame.
Recommended Videos Given that it’s chiefly a big screen operation, nothing has clout in the Indiana Jones icon department quite like the scenes that are burned into our minds forever, whether it’s the Nazis getting their faces melted off by the Ark of the Covenant or our heroes trying to stomach a steaming-hot helping of monkey brains.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/59/>← Prev Page</a>
