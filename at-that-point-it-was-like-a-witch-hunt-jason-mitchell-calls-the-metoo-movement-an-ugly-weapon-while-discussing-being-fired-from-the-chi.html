MeToo was at the height of everything. Let’s be honest, they do have some monsters out here. They have people who use their position as leverage… For me, nobody ever came out and had a story. The police were never involved.”</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Further into the discussion, Mitchell stated that when the sexual misconduct allegations came out, he thought it would “go away” and the public would forget about it because of the lack of evidence provided by Boone and Davis. Still, when Mitchell was fired from&nbsp;The Chi&nbsp;that same year, and his character Brandon was killed off in the season two finale, he admitted it was a challenging experience and feels he still has a “negative shade” because of the allegations. He added&nbsp;</p><p>“A part of me thought I guess that the public would’ve used their common sense be like ‘hey if the police get [involved]. Or if no female came out and made a statement against him,’ it would kind of just go away. It wasn’t like that. It was tough. I still feel, I’m in this negative shade sometimes with this dark cloud but I’m like ‘you know what I’m not going go let that jade me or take me away from the space I feel like I should be in.'”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Toward the end of his interview, Mitchell explained that although he made a mistake in the past, he feels that he deserves to “be in this space” because God gave him the gift of acting.</p><p>“I feel like I definitely deserve to be here. God gave me a great gift and I deserve to be in this space. Did I make a mistake? Yes, but who’s perfect?”</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>At this time, Davis and Boone have yet to respond to Mitchell’s latest remarks.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SutXnToZitZaCktq%2FAjKKrZq%2BRqHqttcqeZJplp57BpLSMoaynrF2frrS7zWakoqyTnbKtuIycmKWko2LBqbGMppytp59iurDCxKacp6xdlrtuwcalsGavlZa9sLqMsJ%2BipJVisaq%2Fwq6qrKGenHqjscinnmaemaeypXnFq6amZaSdsm6vx6Jm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1146-angel-number-meaning-and-symbolism.html><span>←</span><span>1146 Angel Number Meaning and Symbolism</span></a>
