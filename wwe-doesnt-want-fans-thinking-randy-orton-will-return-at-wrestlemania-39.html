Randy Orton will be around WrestleMania 39, but fans who want to see him on television might be a bit disappointed.

That being said, he is still recovering from that back fusion surgery he had in 2022.</p><p>Randy Orton will be around WrestleMania 39, but fans who want to see him on television might be a bit disappointed. <a href=#>We previously reported </a>that Orton isn’t going to make a return to the ring any time soon.</p><p>During <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer spoke up about Randy Orton’s current status. It was noted that WWE doesn’t want fans thinking Orton is cleared for a return, because he is not 100% ready for action just yet.</p><p>This is what I was told. I was told by WWE that they said it was kinda like, ‘you can put it out,’ it’s not gossip, it was directly told to me that he is not ready to return and they basically said they don’t want people to think that he’s ready to return.”</p><p>We will have to see if Randy Orton makes a return to the ring anyway. That would certainly be against what the company apparently told Dave Meltzer. It would still get one heck of a WrestleMania pop.</p><p>Randy Orton might just be around WrestleMania, because it’s the biggest show of the year. Only time will tell if he pops up on camera in SoFi Stadium, but it will be great to have a locker room leader like The Viper around.</p><p>What’s your take on Randy Orton’s WWE return? Are you losing your mind without Orton on television every week?
