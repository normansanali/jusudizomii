According to sources it has been estimated that Nikki’s overall net worth is $1 million, built by portraying roles in some popular films and TV productions. As she is still an active member of the entertainment industry, and her net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Nikki Blonsky Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Nikki was raised in Nassau County on Long Island. Her parents are of Czech and Irish descent, and she was raised Catholic despite her father being Jewish. As early as three years of age, she started singing and taking vocal lessons. She went to Great Neck North Middle School, and John L. Miller Great Neck North High School for a year before transferring to Village School. She attended the after-school theater program at William A. Shine Great Neck South High School, and took part in productions such as “Sweeney Todd”, “Les Miserables”, and starred in the title role in the opera “Carmen”.</p><p>Before rising to stardom, Blonsky worked in the “Cold Stone” creamery. However, in 2007 she won the role of Tracy Turnblad in the musical film “Hairspray”, the real start of her net worth. Her outstanding performance brought her the “Best Young Actress” award in the 13th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards. She has since performed with celebrities such as <a href=#>Queen Latifah</a>, <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>, <a href=#>Elijah Kelley</a>, <a href=#>Brittany Snow</a> and <a href=#>Allison Janney</a>. Her net worth was beginning to rise.</p><p>Beside her acting career, Nikki is also known as a talented singer and has cooperated with guitarist Jon Kestenbaum while recording a song dedicated to the September 11th terrorist attacks victims.

The quarrel resulted in physical injuries and charges of assault for both families. Other than this, Nikki earned a cosmetology license in 2011 and works as a make-up and hair stylist in her hometown.</p><p>In 2011, Blonsky earned a&nbsp;cosmetology&nbsp;license, and began working part-time as a hairstylist and makeup artist in her hometown of Great Neck, in between acting auditions.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.443349753695><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Nikki Blonsky</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 9, 1988</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Great Neck, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>4 ft 9 in (1.47 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Actor, Dancer</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>Great Neck North Middle School, John L.
