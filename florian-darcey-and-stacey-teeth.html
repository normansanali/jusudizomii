But in Season 4 of <a href=#>Darcey & Stacey</a>, viewers are talking about Stacey's husband <a href=#>Florian Sukaj</a> and his teeth. Or, to be more exact, his clearly brand new teeth that look vastly different from the ones he had in prior seasons.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That's not to say fans are critical. They're just quick to take notice of changes in appearance when it comes to Darcey, Stacey, and their loved ones. Viewers also once commented on Darcey's ex Georgi Rusev's new hair when he chopped off his signature locks.</p><p>This isn't anything new, but you have to expect a drastic change in one of the show's main stars to cause a stir.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Florian has brand new teeth on 'Darcey & Stacey.'</h2><p>Darcey and Stacey have never been shy about sharing the reality of their own various procedures from over the years with their fans. And Florian's new teeth are no exception.</p><p>In January 2022, while the third season was still on the air on TLC, Stacey shared before and after photos of Florian's teeth in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Stories.</p><p>Until that point, fans knew Florian to have spaces between most of his teeth and, despite being a model, Florian was prone more to serious looks than huge smiles. To be fair, he still doesn't smile quite as much. But he did have significant work done on his teeth between Seasons 3 and Season 4 of Darcey & Stacey.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>According to Stacey on Instagram, Florian went to Turkey to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comfort Zone Dent</a>, where he had veneers bonded to his teeth. Viewers saw Darcey and Stacey get new veneers in Season 2 when they went all out with makeovers in Turkey, so it's not a huge shock that Florian traveled to the country for his own dental work.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Darcey and Stacey are no strangers to cosmetic procedures.</h2><p>Both Darcey and Stacey have been candid about the work they've had done to their faces and bodies over the years. The procedures between the two of them include nose jobs, liposuction, butt lifts, and plenty of fillers. Of course that's not all, since the twins look vastly different now than they did at the start of their reality TV fame years ago.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>But in a way, it's refreshing to fans that Darcey and Stacey don't keep their affinity for going under the knife a secret from viewers. The sisters seem to embrace that side of themselves.</p><p>Now if only someone could convince them to stop going so heavy on the Instagram filters.</p><p>Watch Darcey & Stacey on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7mwvsiapWackaewpsWMmqWdZaOprqSx2Garnp2knQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edie-inksetter-wikipedia-biography-age-instagram-husband-net-worth-and-10-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Edie Inksetter: Wikipedia, Biography, Age, Instagram, Husband, Net Worth, and 10 Facts</span></a>
