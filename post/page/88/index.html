<a href=../../../the-true-meaning-behind-straightenin-by-migos.html></a>
Produced by DJ Durel, "Straightenin"&nbsp;marks the group's first release of 2021. On the new single, the Atlanta natives rap about finally making their comeback after a long break, claiming they're back to "straighten" their competition. The first verse, featuring Quavo, is a perfect example.
"Ni***s act like the gang went vacant / Ni***s act like somеthing been taken," Quavo raps. "Ain't nothing but a little bit of straightenin'." In the same verse, he tells fans how he's been spending his break, which apparently included an island getaway and a whole lot of money.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Uncomfortable Dissonance of Swarms Faux Documentary</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>

Loretta Greene (Heather Simms) is a fantastic character — there’s enough there for an entirely new show — but “Fallin’ Through the Cracks” is heavy on gap-filling exposition. Swarm is a feverish show, a liquid nightmare that obscures and provokes. To achieve this feeling, Janine Nabers and Donald Glover’s series about a murderous obsessive generally opts for a heightened visual aesthetic. Grainy and lush, it’s naturalistic, but only to a point — this is a show that continuously drifts into madness, after all.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tyga Net Worth: Earnings &amp;amp; Lifestyle</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>
