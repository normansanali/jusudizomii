Home is where my heart is still beating
And I don't know when I'll see her again
I hate to see her cry when I'm leaving
But now, I'm a thousand miles away againAnd she feels like Carolina,
Looks like California
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks like I'm behind her,
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kyra Sedgwick has Proof shes no one-trick pony since The Closer ended Sun 22 May 2022 15:21</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>
