Baby’s into runnin’ round
Hangin’ with the crowd
Putting your business in the street
Talkin’ out loud
Sayin’ you bought her this and that
And how much you done spent

To the sad sad truth

I wonder wonder wonder wonder who)
Taught her how to talk like that</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/54/>← Prev Page</a>
