We were trying to encourage him to have a second baby.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4j36_wlAPC/</p><p>Army wife Amy Thompson shared: “Harry was saying how little Archie was starting to crawl, how they’ve started eating different foods, [making] all of the funny faces.”</p><p>The prince said this at the event: “It’s unbelievably hard. I have so much respect and admiration for anyone who has to deal with that. I can’t imagine what it’s like to miss so much as they change so quickly.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4qVHKjJDdc/</p><p>This comes not long after other reports painted their situation in a more troubling light, claiming that Markle might be dealing with strong disapproval from the royal family as a whole.</p><p>While this was never proven in any way, there were indeed some indications that there might be some truth to the claims.</p><p>Markle has remained a controversial figure in the circles of the royal family, and some of her actions appear to have drawn the ire of the Queen herself.</p><p>At the same time, she has been doing very well with Prince Harry on the public front, and the two have not given any indication that there might be anything bad in their relationship.</p><p>However, then again, even if things were not going in a good direction, they would probably not make that known too easily.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It would have some damning implications for the entire royal family, which is certainly not something the Queen would want to see. With that in mind, it might take a while until observers see the truth.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegp7avr8Rmn5qqoq56qbXNrapmoJVitrR5xJqenqpdm7yzecBmqp6bn6Oxbq7Am7BmoaNiuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYypqZ6fnpa7tXnAoJiipl1ogXF8kW9m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-simon.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Simon Net Worth $200 Million</span></a>
