And now as Season 22 kicks off, many fans want to know: Why did Kelly choose to leave The Voice?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Kelly Clarkson leave 'The Voice'?</h2><p>The news that Kelly was leaving the show was announced in May 2022. It came as a surprise to many, in part because a contestant that she coached has won in four of the show's last eight seasons. But not everyone was shocked by this as there had been speculation that she was planning to leave for months before that.</p><p>Although Kelly has not officially explained her reasons for leaving, she has been dropping hints.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Q&A</a> at the beginning of 2022, the "Breakaway" singer suggested that she might be making some changes to her life so that she could spend more time with her kids, who are currently 8 and 6.</p><p>"I've decided this year there's just [going to] be a couple of changes for me that I can't say here," Kelly said.</p><p style=text-align:start>She explained, “I’ve been able to make more time just for me and my kiddos and still be able to work," and added, "They only want to hang out with you for so long and that’s now, so I got to take advantage of that."</p><p>But it isn't just her desire to spend more time with her kids. Her schedule is stacked with new projects.</p><p>Besides having her own daytime talk show (which is slated to take the spot of <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres's longtime talk show</a>), Kelly also serves as a co-host and executive producer of <a href=#>American Song Contest</a>, which is designed to be an American answer to the ever-popular Eurovision song contest.</p><p>Furthermore, Kelly revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> exclusively that she’s recorded her first album in five years, which will be released in 2023.</p><p>Clearly, she has a lot on her hands, which explains why she decided to opt out of Season 22.</p><p>And while this may just be a coincidence, she is also scheduled to receive a star on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> on Sept. 19, which just so happens to be the day that Season 22 of The Voice premieres.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Kelly Clarkson ever plan on returning to 'The Voice'?</h2><p>It seems clear that Kelly is going to take this year, and possibly some additional years moving forward, to focus on herself and her family. But that doesn't mean that she's completely done with The Voice. She told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that there’s a good chance she’ll return to the show.</p><p>“I definitely … um, I probably will be back at The Voice at some point,” she said with a laugh. “I might be back at The Voice."</p><p>We're just going to hope that she means yes by that. Fingers crossed we'll see Kelly back as a coach soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajlaG5unnCpZiro6Oku264xJqtnmWknbJuws6imp4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deion-sanders-is-father-to-five-children-meet-the-parents-who-raised-him-and-sister-tracy-knight-473961-html.html><span>←</span><span>Deion Sanders Is Father To Five Children Meet The Parents Who Raised Him And Sister Tracy Knight</span></a>
