And this time it’s her sister Whitney Henriquez — who claimed that she had personally seen Johnny Depp hitting Amber.</span></p><p><span>Let’s get to know her better as this “Whitney Henriquez Bio” proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Whitney Henriquez, Amber Heard Sister</b></h3><p><span>Whitney Henriquez is Amber Heard’s younger sister. The two were raised in a conservative Catholic household with modest finances.</span></p><p><span>During their childhood days, Amber competed in beauty pageants while Whitney chose to pursue an academic career.</span></p><p><span>According to Amber, her sister Whitney was the “best sister” anyone could ever wish for. She explained that Whitney never passed up an opportunity to show up for her, or anyone else she love for that matter. Infact, she was even holding Amber’s hand in the delivery room when Hunter was born.</span></p><p><span>“You’re the strongest, bravest most talented, and kind person I’ve ever known – and you have been from day one. You’re not only my built-in best friend, but you’re also my hero. I’m beyond lucky to have you in my life,” Amber praised her sister in an IG post.</span></p><p><span>As for their mother, she has long left this world. But Whitney still remembers the “sharp pain” of losing her. She confessed that she would “forever feel to have had her in (her) world,” and thanked her for showing her “most true example of kindness and love.”</span></p><p><span>Also, Whitney shared that birthdays were important for their mother. So, even after her death, Whitney often took it to her socials to wish her mother a happy birthday (i.e. on October 1).</span></p><h3><b>Whitney Henriquez Testimony</b></h3><p><span>Whitney Henriquez was the first witness to testify in the 2022 Depp vs Heard defamation trial who claimed that she had personally seen Johnny Depp hitting Amber Heard.</span></p><p><span>After answering some basic questions, Whitney began her testimony by sharing that she first met Johnny sometime in 2011 for </span><i><span>The Rum Diary</span></i><span> press tour. But it wasn’t until a year later, that she formally met him as her sister’s boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Whitney was living with Amber as they shared an apartment at Orange Avenue. Also, she then was splitting her time between there and her boyfriend’s place. Which means, she wasn’t at home all the time.</span></p><p><span>So, at the beginning of Johnny and Amber’s relationship, Whitney and the </span><i><span>Pirates of the Caribbean</span></i><span> star got along at first. Since Johnny was sober at the time, “bright, beautiful, lovely, kind, and generous,” it was very easy to get to know him, she explained.</span></p><p><span>Also, she never had seen her sister so madly in love with somebody. But as Johnny started “using”, there was almost always a fight which ultimately led Amber to lose her smile, humor, and cheeriness.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, she added that Johnny was “controlling” towards Amber’s choice of clothing and “protective” towards Amber’s work.</span></p><p><span>So, over time, Whitney claimed that Johnny started to distance himself from Amber’s side of the family. At some point, he even accused Whitney of doing something “horrendous” she hadn’t done, and then she wasn’t allowed around anymore.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about Johnny and Amber’s fight, Whitney shared that things would get destroyed, and she’s seen Johnny drunk countess times “or too many times for (her) to quantify.”</span></p><p><span>Whitney even went as far as to confess that she also did cocaine with Johnny and watched him on MDMA, Marijuana, Shrooms, etc. And whenever Johnny was on drugs, he was like a different person — almost unrecognizable.</span></p><p><span>Now coming to the marks Whitney saw on Amber, she shared that she occasionally saw bruising, cut lips, split lips, weird marks, burns, and scratches on Amber’s arms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In September 2013, Whitney even allegedly saw Johnny hurling a steak knife at his assistant at a hotel but missed him.</span></p><p><span>Sharing another incident about Johnny’s violent behavior, Whitney added that the actor came up behind her in October 2015 and struck her in the back. To which, Amber responded by smacking Johnny in the face. Which ultimately led to Johnny grabbing Amber’s hair with one hand and “whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other.”</span></p><p><span>So, after the incident, Whitney was then allegedly asked to sign an NDA by Johnny, which she never did, and also accused of selling stories to the media.</span></p><p><span>By the end of her testimony, it was also revealed that Whitney “regrettably” joked with Johnny (over a text) about hitting her sister.</span></p><h3><b>Whitney Henriquez Husband</b></h3><p><span>Whitney Henriquez’s husband </span><a href=#><span>Gavin Henriquez</span></a><span> is the Director Of Operations at </span><i><span>Proper Hospitality</span></i><span>. He’s been in the hospitality business for over 8 years. Prior to this, Gavin worked as an “operations manager” at </span><i><span>Dream Hotel Group</span></i><span>, “office manager” at </span><i><span>Dream Downtown </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Gramercy Park Hotel</span></i><span>, and a “service specialist” at </span><i><span>Marriott International</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>The duo shares two children — a 3-year-old and another two months baby Harlin Willow (in May 2022).</span></p><h3><b>Is Whitney Henriquez On IG?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>whitheard</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Whitney Henriquez Age</b></h3><p><span>Whitney was born on September 18, 1987. That made her 34 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>She is almost a year and a half younger than her sister Amber.</span></p><h3><b>Whitney Henriquez Job</b></h3><p><span>Whitney Henriquez worked in hotels before the 2020 pandemic.</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, her job was associated with food and beverage management. Also, she managed primary events.</span></p><p><span>It seems that Whitney has also dabbled in the world of acting. Back in 2007, she portrayed “Ugna” in the movie </span><i><span>Homo Erectus</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Whitney Henriquez Live Now?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Whitney resided in Glendale, California as of 2022.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>How Tall Is Whitney Henriquez?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>She stands tall at a height under 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm).</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmsKCZqbumxYyhnKeqmabCpsaMm6CoZZiqwKOtzZ1kop9dn7yjedOeqq2hnaS7uns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-henry-kissinger.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Henry Kissinger?
