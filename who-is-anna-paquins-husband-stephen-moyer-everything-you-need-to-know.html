There are aspects of one's private life that are fun and cute and not too revealing."</p><p id=e2IUACwkcWz data-wc=47>That is why they've also shielded them from social media. Speaking to People, Anna said: "They're only 11. But I think it's important to keep them as protected as possible and for them to get to be young without having every single moment of their lives documented."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34da3905ab92-gettyimages-1958227064.jpg><p id=eHtbg2cuq1Q data-wc=24>Anna embraces her role as a stepmother to Stephen's two children from his previous marriage to Lorien Haynes, adding depth to their blended family.</p><p id=ecW1ZcYLEsT data-wc=42>Anna and Stephen's love story began in a manner akin to a modern fairy tale.

By day three or four...oh, this is going to sound so syrupy...but I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. It was within seconds, really, and it just became a thing."</p><p id=eym1j7BlCrf data-wc=70>This sentiment was further echoed in his conversation with "People," where Stephen reflected on the experience of working closely with Anna. "I mean, people ask us a lot, 'Isn't it weird working with your spouse?' And I'm like, 'Well, it's how we met.' We were on set every day together for seven years. And so actually, when we're not working together, it feels like I miss her.
