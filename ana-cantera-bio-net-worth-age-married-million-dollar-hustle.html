These women, including Ana Cantera’s glamorous lifestyles, have been made by selling products, hosting events, and self-branding.</p><p style=text-align:left>But since Ana and the mates were shown living so extravagantly, viewers have been curious about how legitimate the show is. However, the show, despite seeming over the top to some, also appeared to be legit so far.</p><p style=text-align:left>Ana herself has been open over the years about working hard to make a name for herself. Her costars on the show also had their own individual stories of what brought them to where they are.
