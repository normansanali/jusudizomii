Puth later revealed to Billboard&nbsp;(via <a href=#>ET Canada</a>) that their relationship was "very short-lived, very small, but very impactful," adding, "And it really messed me up ... It wasn't like I was the only person on her mind." Adding insult to injury, a source later claimed to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;that the two "never dated." Hm ... who do you believe?</p><p>In addition to awkwardly&nbsp;<a href=#>attempting to use his flirting tactics</a> on Access Hollywood hosts Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover in 2016, Puth&nbsp;was "<a href=#>captured by paparazzi with the Hollywood wild-child Bella Thorne</a> on a Miami beach, then, after she posted a picture with her ex, melted down on Twitter just a few days later," <a href=#>The New York Times</a> reported.&nbsp;When reflecting on these rumored flings and flirtations, Puth confessed, "It was more about the idea of me than actually wanting to be with me and I got that confused with actual love and romanticism."&nbsp;</p><p>Puth elaborated&nbsp;that he still feels underdeveloped in the romance department, telling&nbsp;<a href=#>Vulture</a>, "I've never felt so enamored with somebody that I can't bring myself to move on. And I'm not proud of that. I want to have heartbreak, as masochistic as that is."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2poZ4N6e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wqGYq6SZmnqxwdOhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terran-green-arrest-blue-alert-issued-for-harris-county-man.html><span>←</span><span>Terran Green Arrest: Blue Alert Issued For Harris County Man</span></a>
