<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>The Best Toppings for Hollyberry Cookie in Cookie Run: Kingdom</h1></header><section class=post-content>Recommended Videos<p>Cookie Run: Kingdom is a free-to-play action gacha RPG, the eighth game in the Cookie Run series. In this title, you build up your own Kingdom and take control of five Cookies, battling monsters and trying to unravel the mystery of what happened to the Ancient Heroes that disappeared from the world. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock more and more Cookies through the gacha mechanic and gain <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toppings that will help make your team stronger</a>.</p><p data-injection=true>Having the best team possible is necessary to win battles, whether you’re playing in the game’s story mode or in the arena. The best team is decided by a few different factors: what Cookies you have on your team, what their Toppings are, and your treasures play a big role in determining whether you win or lose. If you manage to pull Hollyberry Cookie, an Ancient Cookie with an extremely low pull rate of 0.054%, you’re already on the path to victory as she’s a fantastic unit. After all, she’s one of the original five Ancient Heroes who protected the world against the Dark Enchantress Cookie before the game began.</p><p>However, with the addition of Toppings, she can become unstoppable. So, which Toppings should you equip on Hollyberry?</p><h2>Best Build for Hollyberry Cookie</h2><p data-injection=true><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best Toppings for each Cookie in Cookie Run: Kingdom</a></strong></p><p>Hollyberry Cookie is a Defense Cookie that’s placed at the front by default, making her a tank. With this in mind, you’ll want to equip her with a build that makes her a solid tank. So, you should go with a complete Solid Almond Toppings build for Hollyberry. This would give her a giant boost in DMG resistance. By fully upgrading these Toppings and having a full Solid Almond build, you’ll gain additional stats and more DMG resistance, making her even tankier.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1e64cbc864bfd7e8304ad72e73a00575?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Kristi Jimenez</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Kristi Jimenez is a Contributing Writer for Gamepur and has been covering video games since 2011 through Twitch and YouTube.
