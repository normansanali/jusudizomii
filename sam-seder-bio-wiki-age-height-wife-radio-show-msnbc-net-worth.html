Air America later renewed Samuel’s contract, giving him top billing and retooling the program as The Sam Seder Show. The show was also moved to a time slot with higher viewership traffic.</p><p>During Mark J. Green’s restricting plan to transform Air America into a profitable leader in progressive talk radio known as ”Air America 2.0”, The Sam Seder Show was canceled on April 13th, 2007, and replaced by WOR Radio Network late-night radio show host Lionel.</p><p>Samuel was relegated to a Sunday show known as Seder on Sunday. Lionel soon lost two-thirds of Samuel’s live associates and listenership. The final Seder Sunday was broadcast on June 1st, 2008. Samuel also occasionally substituted for Randi Rhodes when Rhodes was on Air America, as well as Mike Malloy on The Mike Malloy Show on the Nova M Radio network.</p><p>In 2008, he also started a collaboration with Marc Maron on Maron v. Sender, an hour-long video webcast. In January 2009, Maron v. Sender was renamed Breakroom Live with Maron & Sender and aired live from the kitchen in the Air America offices weekdays. Seder and Maron also hosted a post-show chat with viewers after each episode.</p><p>Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live with Maron & Sender in July 2009. In 2010, Air America was shut down. In November 2009, Samuel hosted a pilot for NBC of an American version of Have I Got News for You. Three years later, in November 2012, it was announced Samuel would again be the host of an American version of the show, this time on TBS.</p><p>In November 2010, Samuel started an independent online podcast also known as The Majority Report. The live talk show format closely matches the previous Air America program, with politically-oriented commentary by Samuel and co-host and interviews with different guests. Samuel offers listeners different tiered levels of access to content around the show via crowdfunding platform Patreon.</p><p>In late 2010, Samuel started occasionally working as a substitute host of Countdown with <strong>Keith Olbermann</strong> when Olbermann was on vacation. In December 2010, Samuel also became co-host of the nationally syndicated progressive radio interview program Ring of Fire, co-hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Florida-based attorney Mike Papantonio. Samuel also works as a political contributor for MSNBC.</p><h2 id=firstHeading class=firstHeading lang=en><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-seder-msnbc></span><span>Sam Seder MSNBC</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On November 28th, 2017, American social media personality, writer and conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich published a post om Medium that resurfaced a deleted tweet Samuel wrote in 2009 joking about the convicted statutory rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, ”Don’t care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man with a great sense of mise en scene.</p><p>Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Samuel tacitly endorsed Polanski’s sex crime. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story. Samuel found out about the brewing controversy the same evening en route to a supermarket after being contacted by MSNBC Senior Vice President of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. asking him to explain the tweet. Samuel replied to Cockfield in an email explaining the point being made in the tweet and the point being made in the tweet and the context in which tweets supporting his claim.</p><p>The next day, on November 29th, 2017, Samuel received a voicemail from Cockfield indicating MSNBC’c upper management was seriously considering cutting ties with him. Samuel responded that MSNBC was making a mistake and that, ”there’s no story here.” Samuel further warned Cockfield that if they moved forward with the termination, ”You guys are going to be the story.” Samuel also requested a formal dissolution email.</p><p>Samuel never received the email, leading him to believe that this employment status was still undecided. On Sunday, December 3rd, 2017, Samuel was notified by Jon Levine of TheWrap that they had been contacted by MSNBC who had decided to terminate Samuel’s contract and were about to break the story through their own publication.</p><p>Samuel quickly sent Cockfield an inquiry regarding his status. Cockfield, at first, did not have a status update but later confirmed MSNBC was, in fact, dropping Samuel.</p><h2 id=firstHeading class=firstHeading lang=en><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-seder-jimmy-dore></span><span>Sam Seder Jimmy Dore</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jimmy Patrick Anthony ”Jimmy” Dore (born 1965) is an American comedian, politician, political commentator, and conspiracy theorist.
