Scottie was featured on the&nbsp;<i>Before the 90 Days</i> series but was later removed from the show after she was convicted of child molestation offences. She will be due for release in January 2021 but will continue her 20-year sentence on parole.</p><p>Skyla featured on the show more recently, as Angela asked her second daughter to donate one of her eggs. Angela wanted to have a child with her new husband Michael and needed to find an egg donor. Skyla refused.</p><h3>Angela Deem’s grandchildren</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, viewers have noted there are six grandchildren currently living in the Deem household.</p><p>Three of the grandchildren are Scottie’s, three are Skyla’s.</p><p>Skyla Deem’s children are called Marlee, Sidney and Larry Burch. Scottie’s children are called London, Ana and Ariah Deem. Scottie and Angela appeared on&nbsp;Maury to discuss the paternity of two of Scottie’s daughters. The first of these episodes aired&nbsp;on February 20th, 2015.</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong>90 DAY UPDATE:</strong></span></a> What happened to Angela Deem’s mom Glenda?</li></ul><h3>Where are Angela Deem’s kids now?</h3><p>There are many questions about Angela Deem’s daughters, given that Angela is often looking after all of her grandkids.</p><p>As mentioned, Scottie Deem is eligible for parole and is due to be released in January 2021. Angela has looked after Scottie’s children but it is unknown whether they are allowed to return to Scottie’s care, as she is now on Georgia’s sex offenders register. It is likely the three grandchildren will stay with Angela.</p><p>Less is known about Skyla, as we occasionally see her on the TLC series but do not have much information about her life outside the show.</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MISSING:</strong></a></span> Why is Geoffrey not on 90 Day Fiancé?</li></ul><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram">View this post on Instagram<p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackLivesMatter</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center">A post shared by <a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angela & Michael</a> (@deemangela) on Jun 3, 2020 at 11:51am PDT</p></figure>View Instagram Post<p style=text-align:center>WATCH 90 DAY FIANCÉ: HAPPILY EVER AFTER SUNDAYS ON TLC&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;<strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON</strong>&nbsp;<span><span style=text-decoration:underline><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">INSTAGRAM</a></span>&nbsp;</span><strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;<span style=text-decoration:underline><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqbmke5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxooJ%2Bseq6tzbJkpKGUqHqlu8SsZJqml5q5onnFq6amZWlleqWt2GadopmemLJutMCvnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yggdrasil.html><span>←</span><span>Yggdrasil, The Sacred Tree Of Life From Norse Mythology</span></a>
