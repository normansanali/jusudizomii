By 1967, John Wayne Gacy and Myers had two children — Michael and Christine. Unbeknownst to Myers, her husband was living a double life. It was during their marriage that Gacy began seducing young boys. As reported by <a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, one of the boys he attacked was an employee at one of the Kentucky Fried Chicken branches. Gacy brought the boy to his home, served him alcohol, and strangled him until he fainted. When he came to, he drove the boy home and fired him from his job days after. He did all that on the night Myers gave birth to their daughter in a hospital.</p><p dir=ltr>Gacy had been luring boys into his home, and in 1968, he was charged with sexual assault and sodomy. Although he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes, he was released on parole for being a model prisoner after just 18 months. Learning about her husband's illicit activities, Myers filed for divorce. Gacy never saw his ex-wife and two children again (via <a href=#>Infamost</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElm9tcWpfn7ypuoywmLKmlWK0oq%2FYrGSupqOawbW4yKeeZpufo7umr9OipqdlpKR6rLHNrayco6lis7O1xJ1knKCZmLimuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jadeveon-clowneys-net-worth-fact-career-awards-biography-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Jadeveon Clowneys net worth, fact, career, awards, biography &amp;amp; life story</span></a>
