Cyrus was previously married to Billy Ray Cyrus for almost 30 years and the pair got divorced in 2022. Shortly after, Cyrus married Prison Break star Dominic Purcell in 2023, but her new marriage is also presenting a few bumps of its own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was so scared when I first met Dom, my husband, which was not that long ago," Cyrus shared on her and daughter&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Brandi Cyrus</a>'s March 28 episode of their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Sorry We're Stoned</a>&nbsp;podcast. "But it is crazy because I am a Taurus and he is an Aquarius, and every single thing I read said, 'Don't even do it. It is the absolute worst pairing.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Astrology aside, Cyrus shared that she and Purcell simply deal with their problems in different ways. She shared that she has a tendency to "take things personally," while he has a "very blunt" way of speaking that can cause clashes between the two of them — something she attributes to her upbringing. "I was an only child, I was adopted, so I was coddled a lot," Cyrus continued. "I kind of have needed that. But that's just not who he is. He is not emotional."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cyrus then revealed that she now tries a different approach when it comes to her and Purcell's communication. "Instead—now—of me getting so offended, because I respect and love him, that we have conversations. I've never been good at that," she said. "These are definitely issues, but issues also—because I love him—that I'm dealing with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her admission comes amid recent reports that she and Purcell were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in a love triangle with her daughter, Noah Cyrus</a>. A source told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;in early March that Noah was casually seeing Purcell before he married her mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Noah and Dominic were seeing each other in a friends with&nbsp;benefits way, off and on. They stopped seeing each other and then Tish started something&nbsp;up," the source told the outlet, adding that "Tish knew he had been seeing Noah."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While none of the parties have addressed the rumors publicly, the source noted that Noah and Purcell stopped their relationship before he started dating her mom: "Tish never gave Noah the chance to talk about&nbsp;all of this before they got married."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706KqoWWTrr%2B2v4ydpqahnp6wbrzUq5qepJxiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dnsC0wcSsZHFuYmd%2BcYQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-debuting-4-unreleased-songs-tonight.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Is Debuting 4 Unreleased Songs at Midnight</span></a>
