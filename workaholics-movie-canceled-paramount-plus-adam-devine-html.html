This news is, in DeVine’s words, “the loosest butthole.” DeVine expressed emotional vulnerability in an Instagram caption, writing that he and others working on the film are “deeply butt hurt about this decision because we were so excited to bring the weird one last time.” Culprit Paramount+ allegedly cut the reunion film because didn’t “fit their new ‘global’ strategy,” though the streamer clearly failed to consider how this would negatively affect their “bring the weird” sector.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adam Devine (@adamdevine)</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcpahrlt002b3b6rl9emf3wj@published data-word-count=67>“I’m butt hurt that I don’t get to work with my best friends again.
