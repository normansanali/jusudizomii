<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>KBS Broadcaster Banned BTSs New Song For Using Slang And Crude Language</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>BTS has encountered a little setback ahead of the release of Proof, their impending anniversary anthology album. On June 8, broadcaster KBS criticized the group’s upcoming songs Run BTS, Born Singer, and For Youth off their new anniversary album Proof for employing slang and vulgar language.&nbsp;However, KBS has considered the septet’s new comeback single, Yet to Come, suitable for airing. Unfit songs will not be played on the station, and the group will not be allowed to perform them on the station’s music programs.</p><h2>BTS’ new tracks from their forthcoming album Proof will not be played on KBS’ music shows.</h2><p>Following a comprehensive evaluation by the board, three songs from BTS’ special anniversary album Proof have been found unacceptable for transmission, according to an update on KBS’ official website.&nbsp;Bangtan’s Race KBS has judged BTS, the first single on CD 2 of their forthcoming anthology album Proof, inappropriate for transmission.</p><p>According to KBS, the song includes obscene lyrics and slang, making it unsuitable for broadcast. Run The main single from their fourth EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2, was BTS.&nbsp;Born Singer, the opening track on Proof’s CD 1, has likewise been declared inappropriate for transmission for identical reasons by KBS. The septet first published the song as a free internet download in July 2013.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTS-1.jpeg alt=BTS width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Finally, for unusual circumstances, the board has postponed their scheduled tune For Youth, the 14th track on CD 3. The words of the music playing in the background inside the performance venue, which was included in the first 30 seconds of the introduction, were not included in the official lyrics of the tune.&nbsp;There is, however, some relief for ARMYs. Yet to Come, their new title tune, has been approved by the board and will be broadcast on the station for fans to enjoy.</p><p>Despite the restriction, ARMYs are pleased to listen to this fresh new music. KBS may have banned these tracks for containing profanities and coarse language, but ARMYs are excited to listen to these forbidden tracks. Netizens said that this reminds them of the old Bangtan days and that they haven’t heard the members utilize strong language in their songs in a long time.</p><p>Check out the following ARMY reactions:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>they also banned Dope bc Hoseok said “weak losers and whiney idiots” so the “vulgar” words on Run BTS may not even be that bad KBS is just being a pussey about it kashskshsjs <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/TK36hRQkOk</a></p><p>— lea⁷ (@seokjinbit) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>ARMY: run BTS gonna be a cute song</p><p>“KBS BANNED RUN BTS bc it contain profanity and several vulgar words.”</p><p>I think they got confused bc of Taehyung’s cute english “one night in a strange shitty” “city” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/owi33ZEA3o</a></p><p>— BTS PICS ♡ (@GirlWithLuv_24) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2022</a></p><h2>BTS members make a lot of money this year only from their performances.</h2><p>Bangtan will not be stopped. According to reports, the septet grossed more than $94.6 billion from their Permission to Dance On Stage concert series. According to Billboard, 458,000 ARMYs worldwide watched Bangtan’s 11 performances.&nbsp;Bangtan is placed fourth on Billboard’s “Mid-Year Box Score,” after Bad Bunny (37 performances), Elton John (40 performances), and Genesis (35 performances).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BTS-2.jpg alt=BTS width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It is impressive, given that the septet only performed 11 times, while the other musicians on the list performed 35 to 40 times. It’s also noteworthy that Bangtan members are one of only two non-English-speaking musicians to make the top five, along with Bad Bunny. The brilliant seven-piece ensemble performed their Permission To Dance On Stage concert series three times in Seoul, four times in Las Vegas, and once in Los Angeles (3 times).</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiim6tdl7%2BwrcOcmKyslad6o63Np5ydZZKpwLR5zZ6uZqufo7Russ6rZK6rmaO0br%2FLmqWgZZGjsW6v0a6bnmWclruowcCgnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-dowsett-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-475851-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Dowsett Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
