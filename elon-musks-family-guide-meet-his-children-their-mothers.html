Plus being knocked up is a very feral and war-like state of being,” the England native, whose real name is Claire Boucher, captioned a nude bump photo in January 2020. “Might as well be what it is. Plus most of my friends told me not to post them so then I was afflicted with reverse psychology. Interrogated my shame on it and decided it was sum [sic] weird internalized self-hatred to feel uncomfortable about my body. Hope you’re having a nice day!”</p><p>The visual artist <a href=#>gave birth</a> to son<a href=#> X AE A X-II</a> in May 2020. While she and Musk split in September of the following year, they<a href=#> quietly welcomed a baby girl via surrogate</a> in December 2021.</p><p>The “My Sister” singer broke the news of daughter Exa Dark Slideræl’s birth while speaking to Vanity Fair in March 2022. The songwriter went on to say that she and her on-again, off-again partner <a href=#>want “at least” three or four total children.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but<a href=#> we’re very fluid</a>,” Grimes said of her relationship status with Musk at the time. “We live in separate houses. We’re best friends. We see each other all the time. … We just have our own thing going on, and I don’t expect other people to understand.”</p><p>Grimes clarified via Twitter when the interview was published that she and Musk had “broken up again,” writing, “He’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see how the University of Pennsylvania grad’s family has grown over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksq27zWakrqubqHqnrcyio7Jll6q2pbGMppyerF2dtrR5wqGgpZyimrtuwMeeoKtlnaTBqbHRrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corporate-fraud-drives-zalman-to-bankruptcy.html><span>←</span><span>Corporate Fraud Drives Zalman to Bankruptcy</span></a>
