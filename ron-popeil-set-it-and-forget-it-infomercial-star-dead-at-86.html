The New York City-native founded the Ronco company in 1964, selling products created by his father, Samuel “S.J.” Popeil, who created the Chop-o-Matic and the Veg-o-Matic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/ron-popeil-001.jpg><p>Following in the footsteps of his father, Popeil went on to create products himself including the Mr. Microphone (the first Karaoke machine), the Popeil Pocket Fisherman, the Buttoneer, the Smokeless Ashtray, Popeil’s Electric Food Dehydrator, the Inside-the-Egg Scrambler, GLH-9 (Great Looking Hair Formula #9) Hair in a Can Spray, the Rhinestone Stud Setter (Later called the Bedazzler), the Cap Snaffler, the Popeil Automatic Pasta Maker and the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator.</p><p>His products can be seen in the Smithsonian Museum today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/ron-popeil-003.jpg><p>According to TMZ, the entrepreneur made a fortune estimated at $200 million in his career and had droves of fans who called themselves “the Rontourage.” He also set a QVC record in 2000 selling over $1 million worth of his Showtime Rotisseries — or approximately 150 units each minute — during a one-hour live segment.</p><p>Perhaps due to the catchiness of his infomercials, Popeil was a hot figure himself, having been portrayed by Dan Aykroyd on a 1976 episode of “Saturday Night Live.” The “SNL” skit saw Aykroyd poking fun of the infomercial style with a fictional “Bat-O-Matic” product.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>A celebrity in his own right, he also made appearances on the likes of “The X-Files,” “King of the Hill,” “The Simpsons,” “Old School” and “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3Bma3Bfp7yvec%2Bop56hnGLApsCMoqtmmZ6Zeqe70aCcrWWZqXqqusWopJ6qk56urXnSrZirZZSarqV5wK1kcW5f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./police-chief-misty-luggins.html><span>←</span><span>Police Chief Misty Luggins Fan Casting for The Bad Guys 2 | myCast</span></a>
