The Nashville actress, engaged to on-again love <strong>Wladimir Klitschko</strong>, made quite a splash in Miami, Fla., on Sunday, May 12, when she and her beau hit the beach together to soak up some sun. <a href=#>See more photos of Hayden Panttiere's bikini bod.</a></p><p>Rocking a purple fringe bandeau top and matching side-tie bottoms, the 23-year-old starlet showed off her super fit frame as she strolled along the shore. At one point, she and Ukrainian boxer Klitschko, 37, were spotted frolicking in the surf and bobbing in and out of the waves.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Celebs who love athletes</a></p><p>As <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> exclusively reported in April, Panettiere got engaged to the heavyweight champ after reuniting with him in January, just 19 months after they mutually agreed to end their two-year romance. "She isn't wearing her ring publicly yet," a friend of the couple told <strong>Us</strong> of the "Telescope" singer, whose ex-boyfriends include NFL player<strong> Scotty McKnight</strong>, Laguna Beach alum <strong>Stephen Colletti</strong>, and her Heroes costar <strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Speaking about her fiance <a href=#>to Glamour magazine</a> for the May issue, the actress said she and Klitschko had "never not been close" since meeting five years ago. But their romance the second time around feels different. "It's like the 2.0 version," she told the mag.</p><p>As for a wedding — and beyond? "I don't really have a plan. I've lived a very big life, and I don't feel my age, and I feel like I was born to be a mother," she said. "Sometimes people speak about [having kids] like, 'Your life ends—you're never going to be able to do anything again!' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about?' Motherhood is the most beautiful, exciting thing, and there's nothing that I feel like I can't accomplish while having children in my life. I would sacrifice having more years of being wherever I want whenever I want for years with my kids."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahmamZsq95z5qlnqyknrKzsYysn6ivo2K8p7KMn6CtZaOaxbp5waKioqaZYq%2BwsNhmp6KbpKq%2FpnmRaWhsaWRqfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fred-mcleod.html><span>←</span><span>Fred Mcleod - Net Worth, Bio, Career, Married, Age, Height, Facts</span></a>
