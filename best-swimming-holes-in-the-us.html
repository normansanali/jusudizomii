And in the thick heat of summer, a secret swimming hole is undoubtedly one of them. These refreshing dips span from crystal clear oases and rocky waterslides to thundering cascades and rolling riverbeds. And the best part? They're all right in your own backyard. So slap on some sunscreen, pack your best picnic, and get out exploring these whimsical, otherworldly pools across America. The water is waiting. And for more gorgeous landscapes, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>50 Beautiful, Obscure Places in the U.S. You Should Visit This Summer</a>.</p><p><strong>Editors' Note:</strong> All of these attractions were open at the time of publication. For the most up-to-date information, including park/attraction hours and current health and safety measures, we recommend double checking their official websites and/or calling ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/slide-rock-state-park-arizona.jpg><p>Water parks aren't the best place to be this summer, but a surprising number of natural alternatives exist—including <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Arizona's Slide Rock State Park</a>. This popular spot lies just seven miles north of Sedona, and it's known for its 80-foot-long slide which—thanks to its algae-slick sandstone, tumbling waters, and 7 percent decline—whisks visitors from top to bottom in the blink of an eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/silver-glen-springs-florida.jpg><p>If questionable, overly chlorinated water has you weary of waterparks, turn to this natural playground instead. Every day, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the Ocala National Forest spring</a> is fed by 65 <i>million</i> gallons of cool, crystal-clear water. The Floridian oasis is made even more idyllic by the verdant pine, oak, and cedar trees which hug its shore. And if you're looking to get completely off the grid, check out the <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/islands-americans-are-allowed-to-visit/ data-target=_blank data-rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Stunning Islands That Americans Are Allowed to Visit Now</span>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/dianas-baths-new-hampshire.jpg><p>New England humidity is no joke and that's precisely why you'll find locals flocking to the cool, crisp waters of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Diana's Baths</a>. Tucked away in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>White Mountain National Forest</a>, near the popular tourist village of North Conway, the spot entices visitors to take a dip with its 12-foot granite waterfall and various potholes, slides, and plunge pools. The area can get crowded on weekends, but wade upstream and you shouldn't have trouble finding a secluded space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/queens-bath-kauai-hawaii.jpg><p>This popular Princeville attraction wows with a sunken tidal pool ringed by volcanic rock. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Queen's Bath</a> is protected from rough ocean surf by its 10- to 15-foot lava shelf but during the winter, stronger waves can create dangerous swimming conditions. For this reason, it's always wise to check the daily surf report before slipping on your suit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/peekamoose-blue-hole-new-york.jpg><p>Cool cerulean waters, shady picnic spots, and a good ol' fashioned rope swing draw swimmers to this Catskills creek. The iconic New York attraction is deep enough for cannonballs, jackknives, and headfirst dives but down stream, you can find a quiet spot to stretch out or wade with little ones. This year, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Blue Hole</a> requires a no-fee permit to visit (240 people are allowed in per day), so just make sure you get in your request ahead of time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/falling-water-falls-arkansas.jpg><p>If you're not interested in completing an arduous hike just to reach your swimming hole of choice, check out this gem in the Ozark National Forest. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Falling Water Falls</a> couldn't be easier to access—pull over on the side of aptly named Falling Water Road, a few miles east of Ben Hur, and you're there. The mineral-rich emerald waters attract in-the-know Arkansans, but between the natural pool and shaded grotto, you shouldn't have trouble carving out your own space. The greater <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Richland Creek Wilderness</a> also offers more than a dozen other falls, so you can explore those as well. And for more whimsical cascades, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>15 Waterfalls So Magical You Won't Believe They're in the U.S.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/johnsons-shut-ins-state-park-missouri.jpg><p>If you find yourself in the Ozarks this summer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Johnson's</a> isn't to be missed. This natural water park is named for its erosion-resistant rocks—AKA shut-ins—which jut smoothly out of the East Fork Black River to create a series of swimmable cascades, potholes, and chutes. Full disclosure: This is one of the busiest state parks in Missouri so if you're planning to camp, you'll definitely want to get your reservation taken care of ASAP.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/mccloud-river-falls-california.jpg><p>Heat waves are no match for this <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>three-in-one NorCal attraction</a>. While each swimming hole can be accessed via its own parking lot, we suggest following the four-mile McCloud River Trail, starting at the base of Mount Shasta. The path crosses Middle McCloud Falls, Upper Falls, and Lower Falls—each the result of the rushing river running head on into erosion-resistant basalt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/warren-falls-vermont.jpg><p>Mad River, which runs through Vermont's <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Green Mountain National Forest</a>, is home to a number of sought-after swimming holes, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Warren Falls</a> being just one of them. The spot can easily be accessed via VT Route 100 and with a convenient parking area, there's no reason to resist. With 10-, 15-, and 20-foot jumps, as well as calm, green-tinted waters, and striking gorge walls, the area offers choose-your-own adventure fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/blue-hole-regional-park-texas.jpg><p>If you've gotten your fill of the Barton Springs Pool and Hamilton Pool Preserve, why not take things just slightly south of Austin—say 40 minutes or so—to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Wimberley's Blue Hole Regional Park</a>? The 126-acre preserve includes four and a half miles of trails, a number of picnic areas and basketball/volleyball courts, and its crown jewel: a lush, cypress-lined swimming hole that's fed by the cool waters of Cypress Creek. Rather soak up the sun and sand? Then, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>17 Best Secret Beach Towns in America</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/little-river-canyon-national-preserve-alabama.jpg><p>This <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Southern Appalachian reserve</a> is home to multiple top-notch swimming holes including the 45-foot Little River Falls and mini Martha's Falls—the latter which goes by "Hippie Hole" among locals. Both of the scenic spots are known for their sandstone bedrock, which has been carved out by the rushing Little River—an attraction that's worth a visit in and of itself as it flows almost entirely atop a mountain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/sliding-rock-north-carolina.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Sliding Rock</a>—just an hour south of Asheville in North Carolina's <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Pisgah National Forest</a>—is no well-kept secret, that's for sure. If you can catch it on an off day, though, it's worth a slight wait to ride. Each passing minute, the 60-foot natural slide is powered by more than 11,000 gallons of freezing-cold mountain water, and the ride is capped off with an exhilarating plummet into an eight-foot-deep plunge pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/three-pools-oregon.jpg><p>Head into Oregon's rugged <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Willamette National Forest</a>, following the North Fork of the Santiam River, and you'll come across this fir- and hemlock-shaded hotspot. With volcanic basalt rocks housing a series of emerald grottos, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Three Pools</a>, in the 20,454-acre Opal Creek Wilderness, is popular among sunbathers and swimmers, but you'll also find deeper pools and outcroppings that attract daredevil cliff-jumpers.

Though the cascades are privately owned, the proprietor graciously allows free-of-charge visits from dawn to dusk. Note that there's no public parking and the spot can be tricky to find on your first go, but that just makes for an even better adventure.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/edge-of-the-world-georgia.jpg><p>Follow the moderate <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Amicalola River Trail</a> for three miles and eventually you'll reach your reward: the unmarked Edge of the World swimming hole. By the time you roll around, you'll certainly have worked up a sweat, so the clear pools and rushing rapids will be the perfect refresher. Plus, it's a popular place to tube if you're looking for an extra adrenaline rush.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/lewis-river-falls-washington.jpg><p>With three separate waterfalls—Lower, Middle, and Upper Falls—<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>this scenic spot</a> offers plenty of room to stretch out, swim, and soak in the misty, moss-shrouded bedrock of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Gifford Pinchot National Forest</a>. If you only have time for one, we suggest Lower Lewis River Falls as it stuns with a highly photogenic 200-foot-wide cascade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/homestead-crater-utah.jpg><p>A dip in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Midway's Homestead Crater</a> requires a reservation—it's $16 for a 40-minute swim on weekends—but hear us out here. The 10,000-year-old geothermal spring is tucked within a towering beehive-shaped chunk of limestone rock. Better yet, since the top of the dome is open and lets in sunlight, its mineral water never drops below 90 degrees. Since the one-of-a-kind pool reaches a depth of 65 feet, scuba diving and snorkeling are also an option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/bull-pen-pool-arizona.jpg><p>The Grand Canyon State is no stranger to extreme heat but luckily, the same goes for swimming holes. <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Bull Pen</a>, about an hour south of Sedona in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Coconino National Forest</a>, pulls out all the stops with a pebbled beach, cool, placid waters, and a 20-foot rock that just begs to be jumped off of. Note that the drive in does include a long rocky service road and little to no GPS service, so keep written directions at the ready.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/jump-creek-falls-idaho.jpg><p>A short quarter-mile hike is all it takes to reach this rugged 60-foot waterfall, which flows down from Idaho's Sands Basin. The stunning scene plays out just an hour from Boise, so it's a great day trip option. What's even more astounding than the falls itself—trust us, you'll want a camera handy—is the 600-foot rock walls that tower over <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the canyon-bound creek</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/devils-punchbowl-colorado.jpg><p>Calling all cliff jumpers! The adrenaline-pumping <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Devil's Punchbowl</a> lies just nine miles southeast of Aspen; program your GPS for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grottos Day Use Area</a> and you'll have no trouble finding it. While a 20-foot plunge into ice-cold White River National Forest waters isn't for everyone, there's also plenty of room to stretch out and observe.
