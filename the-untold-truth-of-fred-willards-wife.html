According to&nbsp;Deadline, she found success in playwriting. Her first play,&nbsp;Elvis and Juliet, debuted in 1994 and had a year-long, sold-out run.&nbsp;When the play <a href=#>made its way to Off-Broadway</a>&nbsp;more than a decade later, her husband Fred starred in it.&nbsp;Mary's 2003 musical comedy,&nbsp;Moon Shine!, earned her multiple awards. That's just the short version of the impressive legacy she left behind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lgZYR2e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5xaucnWWnnrmtrdGdqmavmZuycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-colletti.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Colletti Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
