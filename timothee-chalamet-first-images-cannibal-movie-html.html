Now, we have some new images of Chalamet and his co-star Taylor Russell in the upcoming cannibal love story <a href=#>Bones and All</a>. The images don’t give us much to go by, but we can see these two young lovers are adrift on the road. Russell plays Maren, a young woman who is learning to survive on society’s margins, and Chalamet plays Lee, a drifter. Take a look at the images below:</p><p>Timothee Chalamet and Taylor Russell will star alongside Michael Stuhlbarg, André Holland, Chloë Sevigny, David Gordon-Green, Jessica Harper, Jake Horowitz, and Mark Rylance. Bones and All will reunite Chalamet with his Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino. Bones and All will be Guadagnino’s first feature film since 2018’s Suspiria. Bones and All will also reunite Guadagnino with his writer David Kajganich, who penned Suspiria. Bones and All is based on the novel by Camille DeAngelis. Bones and All tells the story of two young people on a road odyssey discovering themselves and finding their identities.</p><p>We should see Bones and All before the end of the year, as it has an expected release on November 24, 2022. If Timothee Chalamet and Guadagnino can recapture the magic they brought to screen with Call Me By Your Name, this film should be something special. In the meantime, Chalamet is keeping plenty busy with some other major projects that we should get to see in 2023. One of the more interesting projects on Chalamet’s plate is Wonka which will see Hollywood revisiting the famous Roald Dahl character once again. Wonka will be more of an origin story for <a href=#>Wonka</a>, with no Charlies or Grandpa Joes to be found. Chalamet will be playing a young Wonka and tell the story of how he met the Oompa Loompas on one of his adventures. Paul King directs the film and co-writes the script with Simon Farnaby. Chalamet will be co-starring with Olivia Colman, Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan Michael-Key, and more. We should be seeing Wonka just in time for the holidays, with a release date expected for December 15, 2023.</p><p>Of course, the most anticipated project that Timothee Chalamet has on the docket is <a href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">Dune: Part Two</a>. Denis Villeneuve made the decision to split the first book from Frank Herbert into two films. The massive sci-fi blockbuster will pick up right where the previous entry left off, with Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) being accepted into a Fremen sietch. Returning cast members will be Zendaya, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Stellan Skarsgard, and Dave Bautista. There have also been some interesting and anticipated choices for the new cast members, with Christoper Walken set to play Emperor Shaddam IV, <a href=#>Austin Butler</a> playing Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, and <a href=#>Florence Pugh</a> playing Princess Irulan. We should be seeing Dune: Part Two when it hits theaters on November 17, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismaK8tbTEnmScoJGhrq6x02adoqqjqXqqucCgnKxlk5a7r7XBmqNmpZ%2BrtqZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sea-of-stars-tips.html><span>←</span><span>Sea of Stars tips and tricks: 8 things you should know before playing</span></a>
