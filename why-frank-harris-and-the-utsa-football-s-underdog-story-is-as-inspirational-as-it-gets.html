With brilliant tactician Jeff Traylor calling the shots, UTSA turned a lot of heads and silenced a lot of critics.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=#>Frank Harris</a> slew personal demons of his own. Proving that he just needed to shake off the injury bug, <a href=#>Frank Harris</a> notched 3,177 passing yards, 566 rushing yards, 33 total touchdowns, and six interceptions in 2021. The Fan Arch athlete also earned second-team All-Conference USA honors in the process, as UTSA finished No. 44 nationally in yards per pass — up from No. 96 in 2020.</p><p class=p1>“He’s probably the most improved player I’ve ever coached,” Traylor described&nbsp;<a href=#>Frank Harris</a>, per The Athletic<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>“From where he was when we got here to now, his knowledge of the offense, ability to make all the throws, he’s really taken ownership of the offense. So goes <a href=#>Frank Harris</a>, so goes the UTSA Roadrunners.”</p><p class=p1>While UTSA’s total team effort is the reason behind their success, it’s no secret that <a href=#>Frank Harris</a>’ inspirational play had a lot to do with it. He was the Road Runners’ leading returning passer&nbsp;and&nbsp;rusher.</p><p class=p1>It wasn’t like he was putting up empty stats either. UTSA was actually winning, compiling an 11-1 regular season campaign, marking the program’s longest win streak in history.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>If you can relate to the UTSA quarterback’s underdog story, Fan Arch’s <a href=#>Frank Harris</a>-inspired collection is perfect for you. Come check out our hoodies and other goodies featuring <a href=#>Frank Harris</a> on our website!</p><p class=p1><a href=#>Frank Harris</a> and UTSA made history last year, but the job’s not finished. He’ll be playing in his final year of eligibility and wants to go out with a bang. The Road Runners do face a tough task at hand, with guys like running back Sincere McCormick, along with other notable players, gone this season.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 6-foot, 200-pound quarterback, meanwhile, is up for the challenge and wants to prove that UTSA’s Conference Championship was no fluke.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=#>Frank Harris</a> will enter next season with an even bigger chip on his shoulder. Let’s all watch him work and see just how far he’ll carry the Road Runners.</p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/0758/0260/files/Frank-Harris_480x480.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=p1><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=#>Frank Harris</a> is one of 700+ athletes across all sports affiliated with Fan Arch.
