Hathaway was brought up as a Roman Catholic with what she describes as “very strong principles,” and as a little girl, she dreamed of becoming a nun. But, acting has always been a top priority for her.</p><p>When she was fifteen years old and discovered her elder brother was gay, her connection with the Catholic Church shifted. Because of the church’s embrace of homosexuality, her family left it and later abandoned Episcopalianism as well.</p><p>Hathaway attended Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn and Brooklyn Heights Montessori School. She attended Millburn High School, where she participated in several productions, including Once Upon a Mattress, in which she played Winnifred, and played soccer.</p><p>Subsequently, she made appearances in additional productions at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, including Jane Eyre and Gigi. In 1993, she graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and was the first adolescent to be accepted into the acting department of the Barrow Group Theater Company.</p><p>She attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, for a number of semesters while majoring in English and minoring in Political Science before moving to New York University’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.</p><p>Hathaway performed in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey, and in Carnegie Hall in 1998 and 1999 with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus.</p><p>Her acting style and appearance were first compared to that of Audrey Hepburn and Judy Garland, who she lists as two of her favorite actors.</p><p>Together with Jesse Eisenberg, Debrah Farentino, and Jon Tenney, she portrayed the adolescent Meghan Green. Despite her early success, Hathaway battled anxiety and depression as an adolescent; nevertheless, she claimed in 2008 that she had since recovered.</p><p>She missed her first semester of college to focus on The Princess Diaries, her feature film debut (2001).
