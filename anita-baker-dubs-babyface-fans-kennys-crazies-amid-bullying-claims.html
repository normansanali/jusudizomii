According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indy Star</a>, comedian Loni Love — who opened for Baker a decade and a half ago — said she “hoped she and her team had improved for the better over the years.”</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>Cheryl Lynn, a contemporary from back in the disco days, said “When someone shows you who they are the first time, believe them.” Singer Stephanie Mills said Babyface could come perform with her instead.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>We have got to be better than this!

Also, people were perplexed because they didn’t know Baker wasn’t co-headlining with Babyface. Baker said he was a “special guest/support act, on my tour. This false narrative of a co-headliner is creating unrealistic expectations and aggression from his fans towards me. He should tell you guys the Truth.”</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>Baker then said it’s more juicy for people to blame her than the concert promoter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not P.R. worthy, 2 simply say, maybe Promoter/Others?
