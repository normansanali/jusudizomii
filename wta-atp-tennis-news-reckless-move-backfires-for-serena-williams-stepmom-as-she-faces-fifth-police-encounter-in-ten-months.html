She has not had much luck lately when it comes to winning any cases in her favor which is causing her more and more issues.</p><p>Just recently it was seen that she again endured some trouble that led her to probably be against the law. The trouble involved her abandoning her truck at a remote location without any authorization. Given her track record, this can turn out to be a bigger trouble than anticipated by her.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>During the ongoing divorce, Serena Williams’ ex-stepmom once again puts herself in legal trouble</h2><p>The former Miami nightclub dancer Lakeisha Graham has seen a lot of legal troubles this year, especially with the Florida house case against Richard Williams. However, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>once again she is now in the limelight</a> because she abandoned her huge trailer truck. Abridge. She left the truck on a busy highway last month. This has led to a case filed against her.</p><p>The cops found her truck, a 2001 Wabash white truck abandoned under the bridge on December 28, 2023, at 3:17 pm. This is the fifth time she has been caught doing something illegal where she had to be in touch with the police and the law authorities in the past 10 months.</p><p>Lakeisha Graham has also been in the limelight due to several other issues regarding automobiles like <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>faking the signature</a> of her ex-husband Richard Williams to get ownership of these vehicles. Let’s take a look at that.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Lakeisha Graham and her recent troubles in the legal setup</h2><p>In the year 2023 in July, Lakeisha Graham was pulled over by the Freightliner Columbia Conventional with an obscured or defaced tag according to the records police have. Besides that, she was also halted by the police in May in the past year at Palm Beach County because she was driving the same truck with tags that had expired.</p><p>Besides that, even in February 2023, she received 2 citations for having a vehicle being driven with expired tags again with a utility trailer. Not just that, the vehicles she allegedly stole from Richard Williams, also accepted that she sold them without Richard’s knowledge. We are not sure how this year would look like for her if her acts of non-accountability continue this way!</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Distressing Serena Williams Reality Leaves Gaping Void That’s Nearly Impossible to Fill for Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9atmGaZpKV6tbHNp6CsZZ6axLR50Z6apKSVqMBuuc6vnGaakZi4p7XRnqpmnp%2BnerSx0Z6lmmWnnrmttcCmqmarpJq9rrvMZpisZaOdsm6ywJycrGWWnrO1tIyppqWhk5p6prrCqKynrJWneqq6jK2cp2WdpLu1tNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./narin-amara.html><span>←</span><span>Narin Amara- Age, Boyfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career, Nationality</span></a>
