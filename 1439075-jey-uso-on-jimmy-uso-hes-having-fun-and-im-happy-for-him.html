Just recognize what we’re doing right now. Like, we’re here. Bloodline’s still running both shows. We’re still running it, Uce. Regardless of what’s happening, let’s take a beat and see what we’re doing here, man.’</p><p>“Never in a million years did I think we’d be split and handling both shows. And they have a lot of segments. When I’m on, I have a lot of segments. So I appreciate that. And yeah, I do miss them. I see them come out as a group; I automatically know. I see it in their faces; they’re having fun. Especially my brother, Jimmy, on that side. He’s having fun, and I’m happy for him. He’s breaking out of his shell now, Uce. If you can see that.”</p><p>When asked if he thinks the only way for them to show what they were capable of was to break them apart, Jey believes that to be the case.</p><p>“Yes, yes. Jimmy’s a funny dude, naturally, man. He’s got it,” Jey Uso said. “He’s only shown like snippets of that stuff on TV. But we are always belly rolling all the time around him in the locker room, behind the scenes. I’m just glad people are starting to see that, man.”</p><p><a href=#>Jey Uso On The Rock Potentially Facing Roman Reigns: ‘We Ready To See That’</a></p><p>What do you make of Jey Uso’s comments?
