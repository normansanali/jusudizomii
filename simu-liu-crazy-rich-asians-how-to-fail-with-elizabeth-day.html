So the fact Crazy Rich Asians had a predominantly Asian cast was a big deal.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>He recalled thinking, “if I don’t get in Crazy Rich Asians, this could be it for me”. But tragically he didn’t make the cut.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>He auditioned for the lead, but Henry Golding got the part. Then the casting team suggested he audition for the lead’s best mate Colin, but that role went to Chris Pang.</p><p>“I must have auditioned for that movie four times. At the very end, [they told me], ‘oh sorry, we found all our parts. It’s not gonna go your way’. I just remember being devastated at the time.”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Liu then claimed he heard some pretty soul-crushing words from the film’s director Jon M. Chu. But it’s worth mentioning Chu has denied he made the comments and he and Liu are pals now.</p><p>“Through some sort of broken telephone, whether it had gone through a studio exec or a casting director before it got to our side, [I heard], ‘Well Simu doesn’t have the X-factor. The It factor’. And that was just such a crushing blow for me.</p><p>“… It felt like someone was telling me that I just wasn’t good enough, that I just wasn’t likeable. I didn’t have that thing that made people want to watch it. It was at a time that was very difficult for me, I was trying to figure out whether I could be the lead character or whether I could only be a supporting character for my entire career.”</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=156 data-injectable=false>Simu Liu was recently cast in Greta Gerwig’s excitingly camp <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a> live-action flick. He described filming the project as “unfairly fun”.</p><p>“It’s very pink. There’s a lot of pink which is honestly a lot of fun to come into work everyday. There’s been multiple times on this production where we’ve looked at each other — the cast, crew, even Greta — and like, ‘how are we getting paid to do this? This is insane.’</p><p>It’s a good sign. Everyday feels like we’re just going to play. I can’t wait for people to see it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqKlpWK5qsGMnKmasqliv6qvx2aYrKGRo8ButM6wZK2nXZuuqriMsKCtoF2auarGwJucraBdma66ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spokeswoman-sleeping-willowbrook-mall-easter-bunny-was-playing-game.html><span>←</span><span>Spokeswoman: 'Sleeping' Willowbrook Mall Easter Bunny Was Playing Game</span></a>
