Nearly two years after <a href=#><strong>John Cena</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Shay Shariatzadeh</strong></a> tied the knot, they seemingly <a href=#>hosted a second wedding</a>.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Playing With Fire&nbsp;</i>actor, 45, and the engineer, 33, appeared to<a href=#> celebrate their nuptials in Vancouver, Canada</a>, on Friday, July 15, according to photos obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>. Cena wore a blue suit as he held his bride’s hand as they entered the Vancouver Club, where they exchanged vows for a second time, <a href=#><i>People </i></a>reports. Shay, who hails from Canada, wore a<a href=#> halter-style wedding gown</a> with an open back.</p><p class=p1>The pair, who were first linked in March 2019, previously <a href=#>wed in October 2020 in an intimate Tampa, Florida, ceremony</a>. While the couple kept their marriage plans low-key, the former wrestler made headlines when he alluded to how he was feeling ahead of the big day.</p><p class=p1>“Love involves constant effort,” Cena tweeted days before the nuptials. “When you are truly ready to let love in and give to love all it needs to flourish, I feel there is no greater more rewarding connection.”</p><p class=p1>The <a href=#>WWE</a> alum — who split from ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a> in July 2018 — and Shariatzadeh’s romance continued to heat up as they <a href=#>frequently packed on the PDA</a> and attended red carpets together.</p><p class=p1>“[John and Shay] look incredible together,”&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Seth Rollins</strong></a> <a href=#>exclusively gushed to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in January 2020</a> of his wrestling pal and Shariatzadeh. “I have not seen him this happy in a long time. So that’s really cool.”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Blockers&nbsp;</i>actor and his wife are <a href=#>basking in their newlywed bliss</a>, they <a href=#>aren’t quite ready to discuss expanding their family</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s hard work to balance the time I need to run myself correctly. It’s work to be the best partner and husband I can be to my loving wife,” Cena admitted <a href=#>during a January appearance on the&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Drew Barrymore Show</a>. “</i>It’s hard to keep connections with those in my life that I love. And it’s also hard to put in an honest day’s work.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “You have to have passion for [being a parent]. You have to have fuel for it. It’s like saying to someone, ‘Man, you know, you’re pretty good with your hands, you’d be a great carpenter,’ but if<a href=#> I want to be an actor</a>, I’ll be an actor.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Neither Cena — who was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Huberdeau</strong></a> — nor Shariatzadeh have publicly addressed their Canadian wedding celebration, but they have been candid about their sweet romance through the years.</p><p class=p1>“I can say with great confidence I’m extremely happy,” the&nbsp;<i>Bumblebee&nbsp;</i>star said of his love during a&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;</i>show appearance in November 2019, before discussing why they’ve kept their relationship private. “Every experience in life is a chance for us to know who we are and who we’re not and just because I went down one avenue in life doesn’t mean that I’m going to repeat going down that avenue. If there’s a learning experience for me, and a takeaway for me, it’s OK to be who you are and it’s OK to establish boundaries.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijeqSxzZpkrKCRrnq0tMCroJqsqpaxprSMoJytZZ2Wv7O1xJ1kmp%2BRnrtuvsSppqusXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joaquin-phoenix-april-fools-day-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joaquin Phoenix Just Released A New Movie For April Fools Day</span></a>
