She targeted him and his death was intentional," Douglas Gissendaner's loved ones said in a written statement.</p><p>"In the last 18 years, our mission has been to seek justice for Doug's murder and to keep his memory alive. We have faith in our legal system and do believe that Kelly has been afforded every right that our legal system affords.</p><p>"As the murderer, she's been given more rights and opportunity over the last 18 years than she ever afforded to Doug who, again, is the victim here. She had no mercy, gave him no rights, no choices, nor the opportunity to live his life. His life was not hers to take."</p><p>In the hours before her death, Gissendaner sought stays of executions on a number of fronts, claiming it was not fair she got death while her lover didn't, that the execution drugs might be defective, and that she had turned her life around and found religion while in prison.</p><p>She requested her final meal last week: cheese dip with chips, Texas fajita nachos and a diet frosted lemonade.</p><p>Additional reporting by Gabe Gutierrez.</p><p class=endmark><strong><a href=#>This article originally appeared on NBC News.com</a>.
