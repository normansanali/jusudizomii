It’s the second time I’ve played a paraplegic. The trick to acting in a wheelchair is that the wheelchair does most of the work for you. That’s how you sell it, you kind of just sit there. The hardest thing about it was just moving myself up and down the stairs, lifting myself on and off wheelchairs.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false><strong>Danielle Bisutti:</strong> She has a ripped upper body now. Do not try to arm wrestle her because that’s going to be a sad state of affairs.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false><strong>Fiona Dourif:</strong> …and I can do ten pushups! No big deal. Like big ones. Like boy pushups. OK, maybe not ten, I might be lying, but still…</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;Now Danielle, your character has that “special” relationship with the Au Pair…</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true><strong>Danielle Bisutti:</strong> Finally! You’re the first person to ask me about this. I thought this would be the most obvious – maybe, I don’t know. Thank you!</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;I’m just curious about her thought process. Is her relationship with her husband that bad where she goes full interest in females, or is this just a rebellious phase?</p><p data-characters=659 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true><strong>Danielle Bisutti:</strong> I don’t think Barb was born with a propensity to be making out with women. The choice I made was this is the first time Barb’s trying it out, but maybe there was the kiss in college, because all girls do that. Katy Perry outed all of us. We’ve all done the cherry lipstick kiss to some girl, but Barb wants things to be done just right. She has a standard of living that she wants everyone around her to uphold. Because of this pressure, I think there’s a sort of emasculation, a cutting off of the family jewels, that she does with her husband, to the point where she becomes the masculine part of this relationship.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Now, all Barb wants is a little help, and in comes this beautiful, blonde, pouty lipped Au Pair who helps her, and that’s where that one line I say, “You’re the only one who actually helps me,” I think there’s this transference that happens. I’m not getting laid by my husband, I’m so not attracted to the Starbuck worker he’s become, and it just sort of falls into place.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;I won’t lie, I feel like I just had to ask that question.</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false><strong>Danielle Bisutti:</strong> Oh, you and a lot of other men out there… [Laughs]</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>WGTC:&nbsp;When you’re filming a horror movie and you go home at night, is it easy to put the terrors and whatnot behind you, or were you looking over your shoulder when you went home for the night?</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true><strong>Fiona Dourif:</strong> You go home exhausted. It didn’t matter whether the lights were on or off. I was out. I had nightmares in Winnipeg a lot, just because Nica goes through it. Everybody’s dead, the suicide of there mother – it put me in a dark place. It’s also really fun to shoot, though.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false><strong>Danielle Bisutti:</strong> See, I wasn’t really scared in Winnipeg, but my mother is a doll collector. My parents are total sci-fi/horror/fantasy geeks, too. My dad’s garage is filled with little figurines in the boxes, so it’s a little scary to walk in there, but sleeping at my mother’s house, in the guest bedroom, with all those dolls in this glass cabinet, can be a little off-putting after having been a part of this legacy.</p>Pages: <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>1</a> <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>2</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>3</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGbnKrAqsLEZqCnrJWnw6qx1madoqeelnqlu9SroJ9llJa7qrHLpZxmmpmowrXAyGaarqqjmnqktNScorJnYmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-kelly.html><span>←</span><span>Erin Kelly - All Thats Interesting</span></a>
