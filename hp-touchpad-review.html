<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The HP TouchPad Review: webOS on the Big Screen</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Messaging</h3><p>A killer feature of the original Palm Pre was its integrated messaging client - something still not duplicated today by any first party. The idea is really nothing revolutionary, we have had unified messaging clients on the desktop for over a decade now, but that doesn't make its impact here any less special.</p><p>The TouchPad's Messaging app currently supports AIM, Google, Skype and Yahoo accounts. I would like to see HP make Messaging truly universal on the TouchPad and add support for MSN and Facebook Messenger here as well. The absence of Facebook chat here is a bit of a shame considering the high quality of the Facebook app itself and the integration of Facebook contacts into the OS.</p><p>The UI is a pretty standard two column layout - contacts on the left, conversations on the right. Like many other multi-paned UIs in webOS 3, you can make the conversation window full screen if you'd like by swiping to the left.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/tablets/HP/TouchPad/messaging_2011-11-07_181615sm.jpg width=600 height=450 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Messaging leverages Synergy and allows you to quickly switch between IM protocols mid conversation without losing your history.</p><p>On the Pre this was most useful for having a conversation over AIM and then continuing it over SMS if your contact left their desk and went mobile. I don't know many use cases where you'd switch between IM services in the middle of a conversation, but thankfully HP included support for sending/receiving SMSes on the TouchPad.</p><p>The feature only works with phones running webOS 2.2 or later, which already eliminates a large portion of the population. But I'm hoping that HP either opens it up to other devices or puts out more competitive smartphones so more users can begin to take advantage of this feature.</p><p>All you need to do is pair your webOS phone to the TouchPad via Bluetooth and you can use the tablet to send/receive text messages. The SMSes actually go through your phone but you'd be able to manage all of your conversations on the TouchPad. I can see this being very useful if you're working and someone is trying to have an SMS conversation with you at the same time. I find that I can either have a SMS conversation or use a computer, I can't do both. The constant switching of devices inevitably hurts productivity - the TouchPad's approach fixes this problem.</p><p>There's just one small issue: SMS functionality on the TouchPad is broken. The Veer is the only phone that'll work with the TouchPad in this capacity and it needs a software update to properly support SMS via the TouchPad. The phone will pair with the TouchPad but any SMSes you send will fail, and none will be received on the tablet:</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/tablets/HP/TouchPad/messaging_2011-13-07_115853sm.jpg width=600 height=450 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Being able to send text messages from a tablet is a huge feature. HP clearly understands the vision that devices need to work together and in a broader sense than just getting data from the same cloud. My biggest concern here is that there is no flagship webOS phone available today that you can use alongside the TouchPad to enable this functionality. The Pre 3 needs to be here now, and to be honest, its successor probably needs to show up shortly thereafter to really convince people to buy two webOS devices.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF2fJdon6llpKTCpLTPmptmqpWrtqbDjnE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-randian-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Randian Net Worth</span></a>
